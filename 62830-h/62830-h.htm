</h2>

<p>“Excuse me, sir, but do you need a man?”</p>

<p>Jack Welsh, foreman of Section Twenty-one, on the Ohio division of the
P. &amp; O., turned sharply around at sound of the voice and inspected the
speaker for a moment.</p>

<p>“A man, yes,” he said, at last. “But not a boy. This ain’t boy’s work.”</p>

<p>And he bent over again to sight along the rail and make sure that the
track was quite level.</p>

<p>“Up a little!” he shouted to the gang who had their crowbars under the
ties some distance ahead.</p>

<p>They heaved at their bars painfully, growing red in the face under the
strain.</p>

<p>“That’ll do! Now keep it there!”</p>

<p>Some of the men braced themselves and held on to their bars, while
others hastened to tamp some gravel solidly under the ties to keep them
in place. The foreman, at leisure for a moment, turned again to the boy,
who had stood by with downcast face, plainly undecided what to do. Welsh
had a kindly Irish heart, which not even the irksomeness of section work
could sour, and he had noted the boy’s fresh face and honest eyes. It
was not an especially handsome face, yet one worth looking twice at, if
only for its frankness.</p>

<p>“What’s yer name, sonny?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Allan West.”</p>

<p>“An’ where’d y’ come from?”</p>

<p>“From Cincinnati.”</p>

<p>The foreman looked the boy over again. His clothes were good, but the
worn, dusty shoes told that the journey of nearly a hundred miles had
been made on foot. He glanced again at the face—no, the boy was not a
tramp; it was easy to see he was ambitious and had ideals; he was no
idler—he would work if he had the chance.</p>

<p>“What made y’ come all that way?” asked Welsh, at last.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t find any work at Cincinnati,” said the boy, and it was
evident that he was speaking the truth. “There’s too many people there
out of work now. So I came on to Loveland and Midland City and
Greenfield, but it’s the same story everywhere. I got some little jobs
here and there, but nothing permanent. I thought perhaps at Wadsworth—”</p>

<p>“No,” interrupted the foreman. “No, Wadsworth’s th’ same way—dead as a
doornail. How old’re you?” he asked, suddenly.</p>

<p>“Seventeen. And indeed I’m very strong,” added the boy, eagerly, as he
caught a gleam of relenting in the other’s eye. “I’m sure I could do the
work.”</p>

<p>He wanted work desperately; he felt that he had to have it, and he
straightened instinctively and drew a long breath of hope as he saw the
foreman examining him more carefully. He had always been glad that he
was muscular and well-built, but never quite so glad as at this moment.</p>

<p>“It’s mighty hard work,” added Jack, reflectively. “Mighty hard. Do y’
think y’ could stand it?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I could, sir,” answered Allan, his face glowing. “Just let me
try.”</p>

<p>“An’ th’ pay’s only a dollar an’ a quarter a day.”</p>

<p>The boy drew a quick breath.</p>

<p>“That’s more than I’ve ever made regularly, sir,” he said. “I’ve always
thought myself lucky if I could earn a dollar a day.”</p>

<p>Jack smiled grimly.</p>

<p>“You’ll earn your dollar an’ a quarter all right at this work,” he said.
“An’ you’ll find it’s mighty little when it comes t’ feedin’ an’
clothin’ an’ lodgin’ yerself. But you’d like t’ try, would y’?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed!” said Allan.</p>

<p>There could be no doubting his eagerness, and as he looked at him, Jack
smiled again.</p>

<p>“I don’t know what th’ road-master’ll say; mebbe he won’t let me keep
you—I know he won’t if he sees you can’t do th’ work.” He looked down
the line toward the gang, who stood leaning on their tools, enjoying the
unusual privilege of a moment’s rest. “But I’m a man short,” he added.
“I had t’ fire one this mornin’. We’ll try you, anyway. Put your coat
an’ vest on th’ hand-car over there, git a pick an’ shovel an’ go up
there with th’ gang.”</p>

<p>The boy flushed with pleasure and hurried away toward the hand-car,
taking off his coat and vest as he went. He was back again in a moment,
armed with the tools.</p>

<p>“Reddy, you show him the ropes!” shouted the foreman to one of the men.</p>

<p>“All roight, sir!” answered Reddy, easily distinguishable by the colour
of his hair. “Come over here, youngster,” he added, as Allan joined the
group. “Now you watch me, an’ you’ll soon be as good a section-man as
they is on th’ road.”</p>

<p>The others laughed good-naturedly, then bent to work again,
straightening the track. For this thing of steel and oak which bound the
East to the West, and which, at first glance, would seem to have been
built, like the Roman roads of old, to last for ever, was in constant
need of attention. The great rails were of the toughest steel that forge
could make; the ties were of the best and soundest oak; the gravel which
served as ballast lay under them a foot deep and extended a foot on
either side; the road-bed was as solid as the art of man could make it,
pounded, tamped, and rolled, until it seemed strong as the eternal
hills.</p>

<p>Yet it did not endure. For every hour of the day there swept over it,
pounding at it, the monstrous freight locomotives, weighing a hundred
tons, marvels of strength and power, pulling long lines of heavy cars,
laden with coal and iron and grain, hurrying to give the Old World of
the abundance of the New. And every hour, too, there flashed over it, at
a speed almost lightning-like, the through passenger trains—the engines
slim, supple, panting, thoroughbred; the lumbering mail-cars and day
coaches; the luxurious Pullmans far heavier than any freight-car.</p>

<p>Day and night these thousands of tons hurled themselves along the rails,
tearing at them at every curve, pounding them at every joint. Small
wonder that they sometimes gave and spread, or broke short off,
especially in zero weather, under the great pressure. Then, too, the
thaws of spring loosened the road-bed and softened it; freshets
undermined it and sapped the foundations of bridge and culvert. A
red-hot cinder from the firebox, dropped on a wooden trestle, might
start a disastrous blaze. And the least defect meant, perhaps, the loss
of a score of lives.</p>

<p>So every day, over the whole length of the line, gangs of section-men
went up and down, putting in a new tie here, replacing a defective rail
there, tightening bolts, straightening the track, clearing the ditches
along the road of water lest it seep under the road-bed and soften it;
doing a thousand and one things that only a section-foreman would think
needful. And all this that passengers and freight alike might go in
safety to their destinations; that the road, at the year’s end, might
declare a dividend.</p>

<p>There was nothing spectacular about their work; there was no romance
connected with it. The passengers who caught a glimpse of them, as the
train flashed by, never gave them a second thought. Their clothes were
always tom and soiled; their hands hard and rough; the tugging at the
bars had pulled their shoulders over into an ungraceful stoop; almost
always they had the haggard, patient look of men who labour beyond their
strength. But they were cogs in the great machine, just as important, in
their way, as the big fly-wheel of a superintendent in the general
offices; more important, sometimes, for the superintendent took frequent
vacations, but the section work could not be neglected for a single day.</p>

<p>Allan West soon discovered what soul-racking work it was. To raise the
rigid track a fraction of an inch required that muscles be strained to
bursting. To replace a tie was a task that tried every nerve and sinew.
The sun beat down upon them mercilessly, bringing out the sweat in
streams. But the boy kept at it bravely, determined to do his part and
hold the place if he could. He was under a good teacher, for Reddy,
otherwise Timothy Magraw, was a thorough-going section-hand. He knew his
work inside and out, and it was only a characteristic Irish
carelessness, a certain unreliability, that kept him in the ranks,
where, indeed, he was quite content to stay.</p>

<p>“Oi d’ want nothin’ else,” he would say. “Oi does me wor-rk, an’ draws
me pay, an’ goes home an’ goes t’ sleep, with niver a thing t’ worrit
me; while Welsh there’s a tossin’ aroun’ thinkin’ o’ what’s before him.
Reespons’bility—that’s th’ thing Oi can’t stand.”</p>

<p>On the wages he drew as section-hand—and with the assistance, in summer,
of a little “truck-patch” back of his house—he managed to keep himself
and his wife and numerous children clothed; they had enough to eat and a
place to sleep, and they were all as happy as possible. So that, in this
case, Reddy’s philosophy seemed not a half-bad one. Certainly this
freedom from responsibility left him in perpetual good-humour that
lightened the work for the whole gang and made the hours pass more
swiftly. Under his direction, the boy soon learned just what was
expected of him, and even drew a word of commendation from his teacher.</p>

<p>“But don’t try to do the work all by yourself, me b’y,” he cautioned,
noting Allan’s eagerness. “We’re all willing t’ help a little. If y’ try
t’ lift that track by yerself, ye’ll wrinch y’r back, an’ll be laid up
fer a week.”</p>

<p>Allan laughed and coloured a little at this good-natured raillery.</p>

<p>“I’ll try not to do more than my share,” he said.</p>

<p>“That’s roight!” approved Reddy, with a nod. “Whin each man does his
share, why, th’ wor-rk goes along stiddy an’ aisy. It’s whin we gits a
shirker on th’ gang like that there Dan Nolan—”</p>

<p>A chorus of low growls from the other men interrupted him. Nolan,
evidently, was not a popular person.</p>

<p>“Who was he?” asked Allan, at the next breathing-spell.</p>

<p>“He’s th’ lazy hound that Jack fired from th’ gang this mornin’,”
answered Reddy, his blue eyes blazing with unaccustomed wrath. “He’s a
reg’lar bad ’un, he is. We used t’ think he was workin’ like anything,
he’d git so red in th’ face, but come t’ find out he had a trick o’
holdin’ his breath t’ make hisself look that way. He was allers
shirkin’, an’ when he had it in fer a feller, no trick was too mean or
dir-rty fer him t’ try. Y’ remimber, boys, whin he dropped that rail on
poor Tom Collins’s foot?”</p>

<p>The gang murmured an angry assent, and bent to their work again. Rod by
rod they worked their way down the track, lifting, straining, tamping
down the gravel. Occasionally a train thundered past, and they stood
aside, leaning on their tools, glad of the moment’s rest. At last, away
in the distance, Allan caught the faint sound of blowing whistles and
ringing bells. The foreman took out his watch, looked at it, and closed
it with a snap.</p>

<p>“Come on, boys,” he said. “It’s dinner-time!”</p>

<p>They went back together to the hand-car at the side of the road, which
was their base of supplies, and slowly got out their dinner-pails. Allan
was sent with a bucket to a farmhouse a quarter of a mile away to get
some fresh water, and, when he returned, he found the men already busy
with their food. They drank the cool water eagerly, for the hot sun had
given them a burning thirst.</p>

<p>“Set down here,” said the foreman, “an’ dip in with me. I’ve got enough
fer three men.”</p>

<p>And Allan sat down right willingly, for his stomach was protesting
loudly against its continued state of emptiness. Never did cheese, fried
ham, boiled eggs, bread, butter, and apple pie taste better. The
compartment in the top of the dinner-pail was filled with coffee, but a
share of this the boy declined, for he had never acquired a taste for
that beverage. At last he settled back with a long sigh of content.</p>

<p>“That went t’ th’ right place, didn’t it?” asked Jack, with twinkling
eyes.</p>

<p>“That it did!” assented Allan, heartily. “I don’t know what I’d have
done if you hadn’t taken pity on me,” he added. “I was simply starving.”</p>

<p>“You had your breakfast this mornin’, didn’t y’?” demanded Jack,
sharply.</p>

<p>Allan coloured a little under his fierce gaze.</p>

<p>“No, sir, I didn’t,” he said, rather hoarsely. “I couldn’t find any work
to do, and I—I couldn’t beg!”</p>

<p>Jack looked at him without speaking, but his eyes were suspiciously
bright.</p>

<p>“So you see, I just had to have this job,” Allan went on. “And now that
I’ve got it, I’m going to do my best to keep it!”</p>

<p>Jack turned away for a moment, before he could trust himself to speak.</p>

<p>“I like your grit,” he said, at last. “It’s th’ right kind. An’ you
won’t have any trouble keepin’ your job. But, man alive, why didn’t y’
tell me y’ was hungry? Jest a hint would ’a’ been enough! Why, th’
wife’ll never fergive me when she hears about it!”</p>

<p>“Oh,” protested Allan, “I couldn’t—”</p>

<p>He stopped without finishing the sentence.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll fergive y’ this time,” said Jack. “Are y’ sure y’ve ate all
y’ kin hold?”</p>

<p>“Every mite,” Allan assured him, his heart warming toward the friendly,
weather-beaten face that looked at him so kindly. “I couldn’t eat
another morsel!”</p>

<p>“All right, then; we’ll see that it don’t occur ag’in,” said Jack,
putting the cover on his pail, and then stretching out in an easier
position. “Now, d’ y’ want a stiddy job here?” he asked.</p>

<p>“If I can get it.”</p>

<p>“I guess y’ kin git it, all right. But how about your home?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t any home,” and the boy gazed out across the fields, his lips
quivering a little despite his efforts to keep them still.</p>

<p>The foreman looked at him for a moment. There was something in the face
that moved him, and he held out his hand impulsively.</p>

<p>“Here, shake!” he said. “I’m your friend.”</p>

<p>The boy put his hand in the great, rough palm extended to him, but he
did not speak—his throat was too full for that.</p>

<p>“Now, if you’re goin’ t’ stay,” went on the other, “you’ve got t’ have
some place t’ board. I’ll board an’ room y’ fer three dollars a week. It
won’t be like Delmonicer’s, but y’ won’t starve—y’ll git yer three
square meals a day. That’ll leave y’ four-fifty a week fer clothes an’
things. How’ll that suit y’?”</p>

<p>The boy looked at him gratefully.</p>

<p>“You are very kind,” he said, huskily. “I’m sure it’s worth more than
three dollars a week.”</p>

<p>“No, it ain’t—not a cent more. Well, that’s settled. Some day, maybe,
you’ll feel like tellin’ me about yerself. I’d like to hear it. But not
now—wait till y’ git used t’ me.”</p>

<p>A freight-train, flying two dirty white flags, to show that it was
running extra and not on a definite schedule, rumbled by, and the
train-crew waved their caps at the section-men, who responded in kind.
The engineer leaned far out the cab window and shouted something, but
his voice was lost in the roar of the train.</p>

<p>“That’s Bill Morrison,” observed Jack, when the train was past. “There
ain’t a finer engineer on th’ road. Two year ago he run into a washout
down here at Oak Furnace. He seen it in time t’ jump, but he told his
fireman t’ jump instead, and he stuck to her an’ tried to stop her. They
found him in th’ ditch under th’ engine, with his leg mashed an’ his arm
broke an’ his head cut open. He opened his eyes fer a minute as they was
draggin’ him out, an’ what d’ y’ think he says?”</p>

<p>Jack paused a moment, while Allan listened breathlessly, with
fast-beating heart.</p>

<p>“He says, ‘Flag Number Three!’ says he, an’ then dropped off senseless
ag’in. They’d forgot all about Number Three, th’ fastest passenger-train
on th’ road, an’ she’d have run into them as sure as shootin’, if it
hadn’t been fer Bill. Well, sir, they hurried out a flagman an’ stopped
her jest in time, an’ you ort t’ seen them passengers when they heard
about Bill! They all went up t’ him where he was layin’ pale-like an’
bleedin’ on th’ ground, an’ they was mighty few of th’ men but what was
blowin’ their noses; an’ as fer the women, they jest naturally slopped
over! Well, they thought Bill was goin’ t’ die, but he pulled through.
Yes, he’s still runnin’ freight—he’s got t’ wait his turn fer promotion;
that’s th’ rule o’ th’ road. But he’s got th’ finest gold watch y’ ever
seen; them passengers sent it t’ him; an’ right in th’ middle of th’
case it says, ‘Flag Number Three.’”</p>

<p>Jack stopped and looked out over the landscape, more affected by his own
story than he cared to show.</p>

<p>As for Allan, he gazed after the fast disappearing train as though it
were an emperor’s triumphal car.</p>

</h2>

<p>“When I was a kid,” continued Welsh, reminiscently, after a moment, “I
was foolish, like all other kids. I thought they wasn’t nothin’ in th’
world so much fun as railroadin’. I made up my mind t’ be a brakeman,
fer I thought all a brakeman had t’ do was t’ set out on top of a car,
with his legs a-hangin’ over, an’ see th’ country, an’ wave his hat at
th’ girls, an’ chase th’ boys off th’ platform, an’ order th’ engineer
around by shakin’ his hand at him. Gee whiz!” and he laughed and slapped
his leg. “It tickles me even yet t’ think what an ijit I was!”</p>

<p>“Did you try braking?” asked Allan.</p>

<p>“Yes—I tried it,” and Welsh’s eyes twinkled; “but I soon got enough.
Them wasn’t th’ days of air-brakes, an’ I tell you they was mighty
little fun in runnin’ along th’ top of a train in th’ dead o’ winter
when th’ cars was covered with ice an’ th’ wind blowin’ fifty mile an
hour. They wasn’t no automatic couplers, neither; a man had t’ go right
in between th’ cars t’ drop in th’ pin, an’ th’ engineer never seemed t’
care how hard he backed down on a feller. After about six months of it,
I come t’ th’ conclusion that section-work was nearer my size. It ain’t
so excitin’, an’ a man don’t make quite so much money; but he’s sure o’
gettin’ home t’ his wife when th’ day’s work’s over, an’ of havin’ all
his legs an’ arms with him. That counts fer a whole lot, I tell yer!”</p>

<p>He had got out a little black pipe as he talked, and filled it with
tobacco from a paper sack. Then he applied a lighted match to the bowl
and sent a long whiff of purple smoke circling upwards.</p>

<p>“There!” he said, leaning back with a sigh of ineffable content. “That’s
better—that’s jest th’ dessert a man wants. You don’t smoke, I guess?”</p>

<p>“No,” and Allan shook his head.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon you’re as well off—better off, maybe; but I begun
smokin’ when I was knee high to a duck.”</p>

<p>“You were telling me about that engineer,” prompted Allan, hoping for
another story. “Are there any more like him?”</p>

<p>“Plenty more!” answered Jack, vigorously. “Why, nine engineers out o’
ten would ’a’ done jest what he done. It comes nat’ral, after a feller’s
worked on th’ road awhile. Th’ road comes t’ be more t’ him than wife ’r
childer—it gits t’ be a kind o’ big idol thet he bows down an’ worships;
an’ his engine’s a little idol thet he thinks more of than he does of
his home. When he ain’t workin’, instead of stayin’ at home an’ weedin’
his garden, or playin’ with his childer, he’ll come down t’ th’
roundhouse an’ pet his engine, an’ polish her up, an’ walk around her
an’ look at her, an’ try her valves an’ watch th’ stokers t’ see thet
they clean her out proper. An’ when she wears out ’r breaks down, why,
you’d think he’d lost his best friend. There was old Cliff Gudgeon. He
had a swell passenger run on th’ east end; but when they got t’ puttin’
four ’r five sleepers on his train, his old engine was too light t’ git
over th’ road on time, so they give him a new one—a great big one—a
beauty. An’ what did Cliff do? Well, sir, he said he was too old t’
learn th’ tricks of another engine, an’ he’d stick to his old one, an’
he’s runnin’ a little accommodation train up here on th’ Hillsboro
branch at seventy-five a month, when he might ’a’ been makin’ twict that
a-handlin’ th’ Royal Blue. Then, there’s Reddy Magraw—now, t’ look at
Reddy, y’ wouldn’t think he was anything but a chuckle-headed Irishman.
Yet, six year ago—”</p>

<p>Reddy had caught the sound of his name, and looked up suddenly.</p>

<p>“Hey, Jack, cut it out!” he called.</p>

<p>Welsh laughed good-naturedly.</p>

<p>“All right!” he said. “He’s th’ most modest man in th’ world, is Reddy.
But they ain’t all that way. There’s Dan Nolan,” and Jack’s face
darkened. “I had him on th’ gang up till this mornin’, but I couldn’t
stan’ him no longer, so I jest fired him. That’s th’ reason there was a
place fer you, m’ boy.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Allan, “Reddy was telling me about him. What was it he did?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t do anything,” laughed Jack. “That was th’ trouble. He was
jest naturally lazy—sneakin’ lazy an’ mean. There’s jest two things a
railroad asks of its men—you might as well learn it now as any time—they
must be on hand when they’re needed, an’ they must be willin’ t’ work.
As long as y’re stiddy an’ willin’ t’ work, y’ won’t have no trouble
holdin’ a job on a railroad.”</p>

<p>Allan looked out across the fields and determined that in these two
respects, at least, he would not be found wanting. He glanced at the
other group, gossiping together in the shade of a tree. They were not
attractive-looking, certainly, but he was beginning to learn already
that a man may be brave and honest, whatever his appearance. They were
laughing at one of Reddy’s jokes, and Allan looked at him with a new
respect, wondering what it was he had done. The foreman watched the
boy’s face with a little smile, reading his thoughts.</p>

<p>“He ain’t much t’ look at, is he?” he said. “But you’ll soon learn—if
you ain’t learnt already—that you can’t judge a man’s inside by his
outside. There’s no place you’ll learn it quicker than on a railroad.
Railroad men, barrin’ th’ passenger train crews, who have t’ keep
themselves spruced up t’ hold their jobs, ain’t much t’ look at, as a
rule, but down at th’ bottom of most of them there allers seems t’ be a
<i>man</i>—a real man—a man who don’t lose his head when he sees death
a-starin’ him in th’ face, but jest grits his teeth an’ sticks to his
post an’ does his duty. Railroad men ain’t little tin gods nor plaster
saints—fur from it!—but they’re worth a mighty sight more than either.
There was Jim Blakeson, th’ skinniest, lankest, most woe-begone-lookin’
feller I ever see outside of a circus. He was brakin’ front-end one
night on third ninety-eight, an’—”</p>

<p>From afar off came the faint blowing of whistles, telling that, in the
town of Wadsworth, the wheels in the factories had started up again,
that men and women were bending again to their tasks, after the brief
noon hour. Welsh stopped abruptly, much to Allan’s disappointment,
knocked out his pipe against his boot-heel, and rose quickly to his
feet. If there was one article in Welsh’s code of honour which stood
before all the rest, it was this: That the railroad which employed him
should have the full use of the ten hours a day for which it paid. To
waste any part of that time was to steal the railroad’s money. It is a
good principle for any man—or for any boy—to cling to.</p>

<p>“One o’clock!” he cried. “Come on, boys! We’ve got a good stretch o’
track to finish up down there.”</p>

<p>The dinner-pails were replaced on the hand-car and it was run down the
road about half a mile and then derailed again. The straining work
began; tugging at the bars, tamping gravel under the ties, driving new
spikes, replacing a fish-plate here and there. And the new hand learned
many things.</p>

<p>He learned that with the advent of the great, modern, ten-wheeled
freight locomotives, all the rails on the line had been replaced with
heavier ones weighing eighty-five pounds to the yard,—850 pounds to
their thirty feet of length,—the old ones being too light to carry such
enormous weights with safety. They were called T-rails, because, in
cross-section, they somewhat resembled that letter. The top of the rail
is the “head”; the thinner stem, the “web”; and the wide, flat bottom,
the “base.” Besides being spiked down to the ties, which are first
firmly bedded in gravel or crushed stone, the rails are bolted together
at the ends with iron bars called “fish-plates.” These are fitted to the
web, one on each side of the junction of two rails, and bolts are then
passed through them and nuts screwed on tightly.</p>

<p>This work of joining the rails is done with such nicety, and the
road-bed built so solidly, that there is no longer such a great rattle
and bang as the trains pass over them—a rattle and bang formerly as
destructive to the track as to the nerves of the passenger. It is the
duty of the section-foreman to see that the six or eight miles of track
which is under his supervision is kept in the best possible shape, and
to inspect it from end to end twice daily, to guard against any
possibility of accident.</p>

<p>As the hours passed, Allan’s muscles began to ache sadly, but there were
few chances to rest. At last the foreman perceived that he was
overworking himself, and sent him and Reddy back to bring up the
hand-car and prepare for the homeward trip. They walked back to where it
stood, rolled it out upon the track, and pumped it down to the spot
where the others were working, Reddy giving Allan his first lesson in
how to work the levers, for there is a right and wrong way of managing a
hand-car, just as there is a right and wrong way of doing everything
else.</p>

<p>“That’s about all we kin do to-day,” and Jack took out his watch and
looked at it reflectively, as the car came rolling up. “I guess we kin
git in before Number Six comes along. What y’ think?” and he looked at
Reddy.</p>

<p>“How much time we got?” asked the latter, for only the foreman of the
gang could afford to carry a watch.</p>

<p>“Twelve minutes.”</p>

<p>“That’s aisy! We kin make it in eight without half-tryin’!”</p>

<p>“All right!” and Jack thrust the watch back into his pocket. “Pile on,
boys!”</p>

<p>And pile on they did, bringing their tools with them. They seized the
levers, and in a moment the car was spinning down the track. There was
something fascinating and invigorating in the motion. As they pumped up
and down, Allan could see the fields, fences, and telegraph-poles
rushing past them. It seemed to him that they were going faster even
than the “flier.” The wind whistled against him and the car jolted back
and forth in an alarming way.</p>

<p>“Hold tight!” yelled Reddy, and they flashed around a curve, across a
high trestle, through a deep cut, and down a long grade on the other
side. Away ahead he could see the chimneys of the town nestling among
the trees. They were down the grade in a moment, and whirling along an
embankment that bordered a wide and placid river, when the car gave a
sudden, violent jolt, ran for fifty feet on three wheels, and then
settled down on the track again.</p>

<p>“Stop her!” yelled the foreman. “Stop her!”</p>

<p>They strained at the levers, but the car seemed alive and sprang away
from them. Twice she almost shook them off, then sullenly succumbed, and
finally stopped.</p>

<p>“Somethin’s th’ matter back there!” panted Jack. “Give her a shove,
Reddy!”</p>

<p>Reddy jumped off and started her back up the track. In a moment the
levers caught, and they were soon at the place where the jolt had
occurred.</p>

<p>The foreman sprang off and for an instant bent over the track. Then he
straightened up with stern face.</p>

<p>“Quick!” he cried. “Jerk that car off th’ track and bring two
fish-plates an’ some spikes. West, take that flag, run up th’ track as
far as y’ kin, an’ flag Number Six. Mind, don’t stop runnin’ till y’ see
her. She’ll have her hands full stoppin’ on that grade.”</p>

<p>With beating heart Allan seized the flag and ran up the track as fast as
his legs would carry him. The thought that the lives of perhaps a
hundred human beings depended upon him set his hands to trembling and
his heart to beating wildly. On and on he went, until his breath came in
gasps and his head sang. It seemed that he must have covered a mile at
least, yet it was only a few hundred feet. And then, away ahead, he saw
the train flash into sight around the curve and come hurtling down the
grade toward him.</p>

<p>He shook loose the flag and waved it wildly over his head, still running
forward. He even shouted, not realizing how puny his voice was. The
engine grew larger and larger with amazing swiftness. He could hear the
roar of the wheels; a shaft of steam leaped into the air, and, an
instant later, the wind brought him the sound of a shrill whistle. He
saw the engineer leaning from his window, and, with a great sob of
relief, knew that he had been seen. He had just presence of mind to
spring from the track, and the train passed him, the wheels grinding and
shrieking under the pressure of the air-brakes, the drivers of the
engine whirling madly backwards. He caught a glimpse of startled
passengers peering from the windows, and then the train was past. But it
was going slower and slower, and stopped at last with a jerk.</p>

<p>When he reached the place, he found Jack explaining to the conductor
about the broken fish-plates and the loose rail. What had caused it
could not be told with certainty—the expansion from the heat, perhaps,
or the vibration from a heavy freight that had passed half an hour
before, or a defect in the plates, which inspection had not revealed.
Allan sat weakly down upon the overturned hand-car. No one paid any heed
to him, and he was astonished that they treated the occurrence so
lightly. Jack and the engineer were joking together. Only the conductor
seemed worried, and that was because the delay would throw his train a
few minutes late.</p>

<p>Half a dozen of the passengers, who had been almost hurled from their
seats by the suddenness of the stop, came hurrying up. All along the
line of coaches windows had been raised, and white, anxious faces were
peering out. Inside the coaches, brakemen and porters were busy picking
up the packages that had been thrown from the racks, and reassuring the
frightened people.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” gasped one of the passengers, a tall, thin,
nervous-looking man, as soon as he reached the conductor’s side.
“Nothing serious, I hope? There’s no danger, is there? My wife and
children are back there—”</p>

<p>The conductor smiled at him indulgently.</p>

<p>“There’s no danger at all, my dear sir,” he interrupted. “The
section-gang here flagged us until they could bolt this rail down. That
is all.”</p>

<p>“But,” protested the man, looking around for sympathy, and obviously
anxious not to appear unduly alarmed, “do you usually throw things about
that way when you stop?”</p>

<p>“No,” said the conductor, smiling again; “but you see we were on a heavy
down-grade, and going pretty fast. I’d advise you gentlemen to get back
into the train at once,” he added, glancing at his watch again. “We’ll
be starting in a minute or two.”</p>

<p>The little group of passengers walked slowly back and disappeared into
the train. Allan, looking after them, caught his first glimpse of one
side of railroad policy—a policy which minimizes every danger, which
does its utmost to keep every peril from the knowledge of its patrons—a
wise policy, since nervousness will never add to safety. Away up the
track he saw the brakeman, who had been sent back as soon as the train
stopped, to prevent the possibility of a rear-end collision, and he
understood dimly something of the wonderful system which guards the
safety of the trains.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, he realized that he was not working, that his place was
with that little group labouring to repair the track, and he sprang to
his feet, but at that instant Jack stood back with a sigh of relief and
turned to the conductor.</p>

<p>“All right,” he said.</p>

<p>The conductor raised his hand, a sharp whistle recalled the brakeman,
who came down the track on a run; the engineer opened his throttle;
there was a long hiss of escaping steam, and the train started slowly.
As it passed him, Allan could see the passengers settling back
contentedly in their seats, the episode already forgotten. In a moment
the train was gone, growing rapidly smaller away down the track ahead of
them. A few extra spikes were driven in to further strengthen the place,
and the hand-car was run out on the track again.</p>

<p>“Y’ made pretty good time,” said Jack to the boy; and then, as he saw
his white face, he added, “Kind o’ winded y’, didn’t it?”</p>

<p>Allan nodded, and climbed silently to his place on the car.</p>

<p>“Shook y’r nerve a little, too, I reckon,” added Jack, as the car
started slowly. “But y’ mustn’t mind a little thing like that, m’ boy.
It’s all in th’ day’s work.”</p>

<p>All in the day’s work! The flagging of a train was an ordinary incident
in the lives of these men. There had, perhaps, been no great danger, yet
the boy caught his breath as he recalled that fearful moment when the
train rushed down upon him. All in the day’s work—for which the road
paid a dollar and a quarter!</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER III.</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>AN ADVENTURE AND A STORY</span>
</h2>

<p>Jack Welsh, section-foreman, lived in a little frame house perched high
on an embankment just back of the railroad yards. The bank had been left
there when the yards had been levelled down, and the railroad company,
always anxious to promote habits of sobriety and industry in its men,
and knowing that no influence makes for such habits as does the
possession of a home, had erected a row of cottages along the top of the
embankment, and offered them on easy terms to its employés. They weren’t
palatial—they weren’t even particularly attractive—but they were homes.</p>

<p>In front, the bank dropped steeply down to the level of the yards, but
behind they sloped more gently, so that each of the cottages had a yard
ample for a vegetable garden. To attend to this was the work of the wife
and the children—a work which always yielded a bountiful reward.</p>

<p>There were six cottages in the row, but one was distinguished from the
others in summer by a mass of vines which clambered over it, and a
garden of sweet-scented flowers which occupied the little front yard.
This was Welsh’s, and he never mounted toward it without a feeling of
pride and a quick rush of affection for the little woman who found time,
amid all her household duties, to add her mite to the world’s beauty. As
he glanced at the other yards, with their litter of trash and broken
playthings, he realized, more keenly perhaps than most of us do, what a
splendid thing it is to render our little corner of the world more
beautiful, instead of making it uglier, as human beings have a way of
doing.</p>

<p>It was toward this little vine-embowered cottage that Jack and Allan
turned their steps, as soon as the hand-car and tools had been deposited
safely in the little section shanty. As they neared the house, a midget
in blue calico came running down the path toward them.</p>

<p>“It’s Mamie,” said Welsh, his face alight with tenderness; and, as the
child swept down upon him, he seized her, kissed her, and swung her to
his shoulder, where she sat screaming in triumph.</p>

<p>They mounted the path so, and, at the door, Mrs. Welsh, a little, plump,
black-eyed woman, met them.</p>

<p>“I’ve brought you a boarder, Mary,” said Welsh, setting Mamie down upon
her sturdy little legs. “Allan West’s his name. I took him on th’ gang
to-day, an’ told him he might come here till he found some place he
liked better.”</p>

<p>“That’s right!” and Mrs. Welsh held out her hand in hearty welcome,
pleased with the boy’s frank face. “We’ll try t’ make you comf’terble,”
she added. “You’re a little late, Jack.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we had t’ stop t’ fix a break,” he answered; and he told her in a
few words the story of the broken fish-plates. “It don’t happen often,”
he added, “but y’ never know when t’ expect it.”</p>

<p>“No, y’ never do,” agreed Mary, her face clouding for an instant, then
clearing with true Irish optimism. “You’ll find th’ wash-basin out there
on th’ back porch, m’ boy,” she added to Allan, and he hastened away to
cleanse himself, so far as soap and water could do it, of the marks of
the day’s toil.</p>

<p>Mrs. Welsh turned again to her husband as soon as the boy was out of
ear-shot.</p>

<p>“Where’d you pick him up, Jack?” she asked. “He ain’t no common tramp.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” agreed her husband. “He looks like a nice boy. He
jest come along an’ wanted a job. He said he’d come from Cincinnati, an’
hadn’t any home; but he didn’t seem t’ want t’ talk about hisself.”</p>

<p>“No home!” repeated Mary, her heart warming with instant sympathy. “Poor
boy! We’ll have t’ look out fer him, Jack.”</p>

<p>“I knew you’d say that, darlint!” cried her husband, and gave her a
hearty hug.</p>

<p>“Go ’long with you!” cried Mary, trying in vain to speak sternly. “I
smell th’ meat a-burnin’!” and she disappeared into the kitchen, while
Jack joined Allan on the back porch.</p>

<p>How good the cool, clean water felt, splashed over hands and face; what
a luxury it was to scrub with the thick lather of the soap, and then
rinse off in a brimming basin of clear water; how delicious it was to be
clean again! Jack dipped his whole head deep into the basin, and then,
after a vigorous rubbing with the towel, took his station before a
little glass and brushed his black hair until it presented a surface
almost as polished as the mirror’s own.</p>

<p>Then Mamie came with the summons to supper, and they hurried in to it,
for ten hours’ work on section will make even a confirmed dyspeptic
hungry—yes, and give him power properly to digest his food.</p>

<p>How pretty the table looked, with its white cloth and shining dishes!
For Mary was a true Irish housewife, with a passion for cleanliness and
a pride in her home. It was growing dark, and a lamp had been lighted
and placed in the middle of the board, making it look bright and cosy.</p>

<p>“You set over there, m’ boy,” said Mary, herself taking the housewife’s
inevitable place behind the coffee-pot, with her husband opposite. “Now,
Mamie, you behave yourself,” she added, for Mamie was peeping around the
lamp at Allan with roguish eyes. “We’re all hungry, Jack, so don’t keep
us waitin’.”</p>

<p>And Jack didn’t.</p>

<p>How good the food smelt, and how good it tasted! Allan relished it more
than he would have done any dinner of “Delmonicer’s,” for Mary was one
of the best of cooks, and only the jaded palate relishes the sauces and
fripperies of French chefs.</p>

<p>“A girl as can’t cook ain’t fit t’ marry,” Mary often said; a maxim
which she had inherited from her mother, and would doubtless hand down
to Mamie. “There’s nothin’ that’ll break up a home quicker ’n a bad
cook, an’ nothin’ that’ll make a man happier ’n a good one.”</p>

<p>Certainly, if cooking were a test, this supper was proof enough of her
fitness for the state of matrimony. There was a great platter of ham and
eggs, fluffy biscuits, and the sweetest of yellow butter. And, since he
did not drink coffee, Allan was given a big glass of fragrant milk to
match Mamie’s. They were tasting one of the best sweets of toil—to sit
down with appetite to a table well-laden.</p>

<p>After supper, they gathered on the front porch, and sat looking down
over the busy, noisy yards. The switch-lamps gleamed in long rows, red
and green and white, telling which tracks were open and which closed.
The yard-engines ran fussily up and down, shifting the freight-cars back
and forth, and arranging them in trains to be sent east or west. Over by
the roundhouse, engines were being run in on the big turntable and from
there into the stalls, where they would be furbished up and overhauled
for the next trip. Others were being brought out, tanks filled with
water, and tenders heaped high with coal, ready for the run to
Parkersburg or Cincinnati. They seemed almost human in their impatience
to be off—breathing deeply in loud pants, the steam now and then
throwing up the safety-valve and “popping off” with a great noise.</p>

<p>The clamour, the hurry, the rush of work, never ceasing from dawn to
dawn, gave the boy a dim understanding of the importance of this great
corporation which he had just begun to serve. He was only a very little
cog in the vast machine, to be sure, but the smoothness of its running
depended upon the little cogs no less than on the big ones.</p>

<p>A man’s figure, indistinct in the twilight, stopped at the gate below
and whistled.</p>

<p>“There’s Reddy Magraw,” said Jack, with a laugh. “I’d forgot—it was so
hot t’-day, we thought we’d go over t’ th’ river an’ take a dip
t’-night. Do you know how t’ swim, Allan?”</p>

<p>“Just a little,” answered Allan; “all I know about it was picked up in
the swimming-pool at the gymnasium at Cincinnati.”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s time y’ learned more,” said Jack. “Every boy ought t’ know
how t’ swim—mebbe some day not only his own life but the lives o’ some
o’ his women-folks’ll depend on him. Come along, an’ we’ll give y’ a
lesson.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be glad to!” Allan cried, and ran indoors for his hat.</p>

<p>Reddy whistled again.</p>

<p>“We’re comin’,” called Jack. “We won’t be gone long,” he added to his
wife, as they started down the path.</p>

<p>“All right, dear,” she answered. “An’ take good care o’ th’ boy.”</p>

<p>Reddy greeted Allan warmly, and thoroughly agreed with Jack that it was
every boy’s duty to learn how to swim. Together they started off briskly
toward the river—across the yards, picking their way carefully over the
maze of tracks, then along the railroad embankment which skirted the
stream, and finally through a corn-field to the water’s edge. The river
looked very wide and still in the semidarkness, and Allan shivered a
little as he looked at it; but the feeling passed in a moment. Reddy had
his clothes off first, and dived in with a splash; Jack waded in to show
Allan the depth. The boy followed, with sudden exhilaration, as he felt
the cool water rise about him.</p>

<p>“This is different from a swimmin’-pool, ain’t it?” said Jack.</p>

<p>“Indeed it is!” agreed Allan; “and a thousand times nicer!”</p>

<p>“Now,” added Jack, “let me give you a lesson,” and he proceeded to
instruct Allan in the intricacies of the broad and powerful breast
stroke.</p>

<p>The boy was an apt pupil, and at the end of twenty minutes had mastered
it sufficiently to be able to make fair progress through the water. He
would have kept on practising, but Jack stopped him.</p>

<p>“We’ve been in long enough,” he said; “you mustn’t overdo it. Come
along, Reddy,” he called to that worthy, who was disporting himself out
in the middle of the current.</p>

<p>As they turned toward the shore the full moon peeped suddenly over a
little hill on the eastern horizon, and cast a broad stream of silver
light across the water, touching every ripple and little wave with magic
beauty.</p>

<p>“Oh, look!” cried Allan. “Look!”</p>

<p>They stood and watched the moon until it sailed proudly above the hill,
and then waded to the bank, rubbed themselves down briskly, and resumed
their clothes, cleansed and purified in spirit as well as body. They
made their way back through the corn-field, but just as they reached the
embankment, Reddy stopped them with a quick, stifled cry.</p>

<p>“Whist!” he said, hoarsely. “Look there! What’s that?”</p>

<p>Straining his eyes through the darkness, Allan saw, far down the track
ahead of them, a dim, white figure. It seemed to be going through some
sort of pantomime, waving its arms wildly above its head.</p>

<p>“It’s a ghost!” whispered Reddy, breathing heavily. “It’s Tim Dorsey’s
ghost! D’ y’ raymimber, Jack, it was jist there thet th’ poor feller was
killed last month! That’s his ghost, sure as I’m standin’ here!”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!” retorted Jack, with a little laugh, but his heart was
beating faster than usual, as he peered through the darkness at the
strange figure. What could it be that would stand there and wave its
arms in that unearthly fashion?</p>

<p>“It’s his ghost!” repeated Reddy. “Come on, Jack; Oi’m a-goin’ back!”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not!” said Jack. “I’m not afraid of a ghost, are you, Allan?”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe in ghosts,” said Allan, but it must be confessed that
his nerves were not wholly steady as he kept his eyes on the strange
figure dancing there in the moonlight.</p>

<p>“If it ain’t a ghost, what is it?” demanded Reddy, hoarsely.</p>

<p>“That’s just what we’re goin’ t’ find out,” answered Jack, and started
forward, resolutely.</p>

<p>Allan went with him, but Reddy kept discreetly in the rear. He was no
coward,—he was as brave as any man in facing a danger which he knew the
nature of,—but all the superstition of his untutored Irish heart held
him back from this unearthly apparition.</p>

<p>As they drew near, its lines became more clearly defined; it was
undoubtedly of human shape, but apparently it had no head, only a pair
of short, stubby arms, which waved wildly in the air, and a pair of legs
that danced frantically. Near at hand it was even more terrifying than
at a distance, and their pace grew slower and slower, while Reddy
stopped short where he was, his teeth chattering, his eyes staring. They
could hear what seemed to be a human voice proceeding from the figure,
raised in a sort of weird incantation, now high, now low. Was it really
a ghost? Allan asked himself; was it really the spirit of the poor
fellow whose life had been crushed out a few weeks before? could it
be....</p>

<p class='caption'>“NEAR AT HAND IT WAS EVEN MORE TERRIFYING THAN AT A DISTANCE”</p>
</div>

<p>Suddenly Jack laughed aloud with relief, and hurried forward.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he called. “It’s no ghost!”</p>

<p>And in a moment Allan saw him reach the figure and pull the white
garment down over its head, disclosing a flushed and wrathful, but very
human, face.</p>

<p>“Thankee, sir,” said a hoarse voice to Jack. “A lady in th’ house back
there give me a clean shirt, an’ I was jest puttin’ it on when I got
stuck in th’ durn thing, an’ couldn’t git it either way. I reckon I’d
’a’ suffocated if you hadn’t come along!”</p>

<p>Jack laughed again.</p>

<p>“We thought you was a ghost!” he said. “You scared Reddy, there, out of
a year’s growth, I reckon. Come here, Reddy,” he called, “an’ take a
look at yer ghost!”</p>

<p>Reddy came cautiously forward and examined the released tramp.</p>

<p>“Well,” he said, at last, “if you ain’t a ghost, you ought t’ be! I
never seed anything that looked more loike one!”</p>

<p>“No, an’ you never will!” retorted Jack. “Come along; it’s time we was
home,” and leaving the tramp to complete his toilet, they hurried away.</p>

<p>They found Mary sitting on the front porch, crooning softly to herself
as she rocked Mamie to sleep. They bade Reddy good night, and sat down
beside her.</p>

<p>“Well, did y’ have a nice time?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” laughed Jack, and told her the story of the ghost.</p>

<p>They sat silent for a time after that, looking down over the busy yards,
breathing in the cool night air, watching the moon as it sailed slowly
up the heavens. Allan felt utterly at rest; for the first time in many
days he felt that he had a home, that there were people in the world who
loved him. The thought brought the quick tears to his eyes; an impulse
to confide in these new friends surged up within him.</p>

<p>“I want to tell you something about myself,” he said, turning to them
quickly. “It’s only right that you should know.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Welsh stopped the lullaby she had been humming, and sat quietly
waiting.</p>

<p>“Just as y’ please,” said Jack, but the boy knew he would be glad to
hear the story.</p>

<p>“It’s not a very long one,” said Allan, his lips trembling, “nor an
unusual one, for that matter. Father was a carpenter, and we lived in a
little home just out of Cincinnati—he and mother and I. We were very
happy, and I went to school every day, while father went in to the city
to his work. But one day I was called from school, and when I got home I
found that father had fallen from a scaffolding he had been working on,
and was so badly injured that he had been taken to a hospital. We
thought for a long time that he would die, but he got better slowly, and
at last we were able to take him home. But he was never able to work any
more,—his spine had been injured so that he could scarcely move
himself,—and our little savings grew smaller and smaller.”</p>

<p>Allan stopped, and looked off across the yards, gripping his hands
together to preserve his self-control.</p>

<p>“Father worried about it,” he went on, at last; “worried so much that he
grew worse and worse, until—until—he brought on a fever. He hadn’t any
strength to fight with. He just sank under it, and died. I was fifteen
years old then—but boys don’t understand at the time how hard things
are. After he was gone—well, it seems now, looking back, that I could
have done something more to help than I did.”</p>

<p>“There, now, don’t be a-blamin’ yerself,” said Jack, consolingly.</p>

<p>The little woman in the rocking-chair leaned over and touched his arm
softly, caressingly.</p>

<p>“No; don’t be blamin’ yerself,” she said. “I know y’ did th’ best y’
could. They ain’t so very much a boy kin do, when it’s money that’s
needed.”</p>

<p>“No,” and Allan drew a deep breath; “nor a woman, either. Though it
wasn’t only that; I’d have worked on; I wouldn’t have given up—but—but—”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Mary, understanding with quick, unfailing sympathy; “it was
th’ mother.”</p>

<p>“She did the best she could,” went on Allan, falteringly. “She tried to
bear up for my sake; but after father was gone she was never quite the
same again; she never seemed to rally from the shock of it. She was
never strong to start with, and I saw that she grew weaker and weaker
every day.” He stopped and cleared his voice. “That’s about all there is
to the story,” he added. “I got a little from the furniture and paid off
some of the debts, but I couldn’t do much. I tried to get work there,
but there didn’t seem to be anybody who wanted me. There were some
distant relatives, but I had never known them—and besides, I didn’t want
to seem a beggar. There wasn’t anything to keep me in Cincinnati, so I
struck out.”</p>

<p>“And y’ did well,” said Welsh. “I’m mighty glad y’ come along jest when
y’ did. Y’ll find enough to do here, if y’ will keep a willin’ hand.
Section work ain’t much, but maybe y’ can git out of it after awhile. Y’
might git a place in th’ yard office if ye’re good at figgers. Ye’ve got
more eddication than some. It’s them that git lifted.”</p>

<p>“You’d better talk!” said the wife. “’Tain’t every man with an
eddication that gits t’ be foreman at your age.”</p>

<p>“No more it ain’t,” and Jack smiled. “Come on; it’s time t’ go t’ bed.
Say good night t’ th’ boy, Mamie.”</p>

<p>“Night,” murmured Mamie, sleepily, and held out her moist, red lips.</p>

<p>With a quick warmth at his heart, Allan stooped and kissed them. It was
the first kiss he had given or received since his mother’s death, and,
after he had got to bed in the little hot attic room, with its single
window looking out upon the yards, he lay for a long time thinking over
the events of the day, and his great good fortune in falling in with
these kindly people. Sometime, perhaps, he might be able to prove how
much their kindness meant to him.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER IV.</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>ALLAN MEETS AN ENEMY</span>
</h2>

<p>It was not until morning that Allan realized how unaccustomed he was to
real labour. As he tried to spring from bed in answer to Jack’s call, he
found every muscle in revolt. How they ached! It was all he could do to
slip his arms into his shirt, and, when he bent over to put on his
shoes, he almost cried out at the twinge it cost him. He hobbled
painfully down-stairs, and Jack saw in a moment what was the matter.</p>

<p>“Yer muscles ain’t used t’ tuggin’ at crowbars an’ shovellin’ gravel,”
he said, laughing. “It’ll wear off in a day or two, but till then ye’ll
have t’ grin an’ bear it, fer they ain’t no cure fer it. But y’ ain’t
goin’ t’ work in them clothes!”</p>

<p>“They’re all I have here,” answered Allan, reddening. “I have a trunk at
Cincinnati with a lot more in, and I thought I’d write for it to-day.”</p>

<p>“But I reckon ye ain’t got any clothes tough enough fer this work. I’ll
fix y’ out,” said Welsh, good-naturedly.</p>

<p>So, after breakfast, he led Allan over to a railroad outfitting shop and
secured him a canvas jumper, a pair of heavy overalls, and a pair of
rough, strong, cowhide shoes.</p>

<p>“There!” he said, viewing his purchases with satisfaction. “Y’ kin pay
fer ’em when y’ git yer first month’s wages. Y’ kin put ’em on over in
th’ section shanty. You go along over there; I’ve got t’ stop an’ see
th’ roadmaster a minute.”</p>

<p>Allan walked on quickly, his bundle under his arm, past the long
passenger station and across the maze of tracks in the lower yards. Here
lines of freight-cars were side-tracked, waiting their turn to be taken
east or west; and, as he hurried past, a man came suddenly out from
behind one of them and laid a strong hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“Here, wait a minute!” he said, roughly. “I’ve got somethin’ t’ say t’
you. Come in here!” And before Allan could think of resistance, he was
pulled behind the row of cars.</p>

<p>Allan found himself looking up into a pair of small, glittering black
eyes, deeply set in a face of which the most prominent features were a
large nose, covered with freckles, and a thick-lipped mouth, which
concealed the jagged teeth beneath but imperfectly. He saw, too, that
his captor was not much older than himself, but that he was considerably
larger and no doubt stronger.</p>

<p>“Ye’re th’ new man on Twenty-one, ain’t you?” he asked, after a moment’s
fierce examination of Allan’s face.</p>

<p>“Yes, I went to work yesterday,” said Allan.</p>

<p>“Well, y’ want t’ quit th’ job mighty quick, d’ y’ see? I’m Dan Nolan,
an’ it’s my job y’ve got. I’d ’a’ got took back if ye hadn’t come along.
So ye’re got t’ git out, d’ y’ hear?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I hear,” answered Allan, quietly, reddening a little; and his
heart began to beat faster at the prospect of trouble ahead.</p>

<p>“If y’ know what’s good fer y’, y’ll git out!” said Nolan, savagely,
clenching his fists. “When’ll y’ quit?”</p>

<p>“As soon as Mr. Welsh discharges me,” answered Allan, still more
quietly.</p>

<p>Nolan glared at him for a moment, seemingly unable to speak.</p>

<p>“D’ y’ mean t’ say y’ won’t git out when I tells you to? I’ll show y’!”
And he struck suddenly and viciously at the boy’s face.</p>

<p>But Allan had been expecting the onslaught, and sprang quickly to one
side. Before Nolan could recover himself, he had ducked under one of the
freight-cars and come up on the other side. Nolan ran around the end of
the car, but the boy was well out of reach.</p>

<p>“I’ll ketch y’!” he cried after him, shaking his fists. “An’ when I do
ketch y’—”</p>

<p>He stopped abruptly and dived back among the cars, for he had caught
sight of Jack Welsh coming across the yards. Allan saw him, too, and
waited for him.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that Dan Nolan?” he asked, as he came up.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was Nolan,” answered Allan.</p>

<p>“Was he threatenin’ you?”</p>

<div id='f054' style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-left:10.0%; width:80%;'>
  <img src='images/facing054.jpg' alt='' style='width:100%' />
<p class='caption'>“HE STRUCK SUDDENLY AND VICIOUSLY AT THE BOY’S FACE”</p>
</div>

<p>“Yes; he told me to get out or he’d lay for me.”</p>

<p>“He did, eh?” and Jack’s lips tightened ominously. “What did y’ tell
him?”</p>

<p>“I told him I’d get out when you discharged me.”</p>

<p>“Y’ did?” and Jack clapped him on the shoulder. “Good fer you! Let me
git my hands on him once, an’ he’ll lave ye alone! But y’ want t’ look
out fer him, m’ boy. If he’d fight fair, y’ could lick him; but he’s a
big, overgrown brute, an’ ’ll try t’ hit y’ from behind sometime, mebbe.
That’s his style, fer he’s a coward.”</p>

<p>“I’ll look out for him,” said Allan; and walked on with beating heart to
the section shanty. Here, while Jack told the story of the encounter
with Nolan, Allan donned his new garments and laid his other ones aside.
The new ones were not beautiful, but at least they were comfortable, and
could defy even the wear and tear of work on section.</p>

<p>The spin on the hand-car out into the open country was full of
exhilaration, and, after an hour’s work, Allan almost forgot his sore
muscles. He found that to-day there was a different class of work to do.
The fences along the right of way were to be repaired, and the right of
way itself placed in order—the grass cut back from the road-bed, the
gravel piled neatly along it, weeds trimmed out, rubbish gathered up,
cattle-guards, posts, and fences at crossings whitewashed. All this,
too, was a revelation to the new hand. He had never thought that a
railroad required so much attention. Rod after rod was gone over in this
way, until it seemed that not a stone was out of place. It was not until
the noon-hour, when he was eating his portion of the lunch Mrs. Welsh
had prepared for them, that he learned the reason for all this.</p>

<p>“Y’ see we’re puttin’ on a few extry touches,” remarked Jack. “Th’ Irish
Brigade goes over th’ road next week.”</p>

<p>“The Irish Brigade?” questioned Allan; and he had a vision of some crack
military organization.</p>

<p>“Yes, th’ Irish Brigade. Twict a year, all th’ section foremen on th’
road ’r’ taken over it t’ look at th’ other sections, an’ see which man
keeps his in th’ best shape. Each man’s section’s graded, an’ th’ one
that gits th’ highest grade gits a prize o’ fifty dollars. We’re goin’
t’ try fer that prize. So’s every other section-gang on th’ line.”</p>

<p>“But what is the Irish Brigade?” questioned the boy.</p>

<p>“The foremen of the section-men. There’s about a hundred, and the
officers give us that name. There’s many a good Irishman like myself
among the foremen;” and a gleam of humour was in Jack’s eyes. “They say
I’m puttin’ my Irish back of me in my talk, but the others stick to it,
more or less. It’s a great time when the Irish Brigade takes its
inspection tour.”</p>

<p>Allan worked with a new interest after that, for he, too, was anxious
that Jack’s section should win the fifty dollars. He could guess how
much such a sum would mean to him. He confided his hopes to Reddy, while
they were working together cutting out some weeds that had sprung up
along the track, but the latter was not enthusiastic.</p>

<p>“Oi don’t know,” he said. “They’s some mighty good section-men on this
road. Why, last year, when Flaherty, o’ Section Tin, got th’ prize, his
grass looked like it ’ud been gone over with a lawnmower, an’ he’d aven
scrubbed th’ black gr’ase from th’ ingines off th’ toies. Oh, it looked
foine; but thin, so did all th’ rist.”</p>

<p>But Allan was full of hope. As he looked back over the mile they had
covered since morning, he told himself that no stretch of track could
possibly be in better order. But, to the foreman’s more critical and
experienced eye, there were still many things wanting, and he promised
himself to go over it again before inspection-day came around.</p>

<p>Every train that passed left some mark behind. From the freights came
great pieces of greasy waste, which littered up the ties, or piles of
ashes sifted down from the fire-box; while with the passengers it was
even worse. The people threw from the coach windows papers, banana
peelings, boxes and bags containing remnants of lunch, bottles, and
every kind of trash. They did not realize that all this must be
patiently gathered up again, in order that the road-bed might be quite
free from litter. Not many of them would have greatly cared.</p>

<p>“It’s amazin’,” remarked Reddy, in the course of the afternoon, “how
little people r’ally know about railroadin’, an’ thin think they know ’t
all. They think that whin th’ road’s built, that’s all they is to it,
an’ all th’ expinse th’ company’s got’s fer runnin’ th’ trains. Why, on
this one division, from Cincinnati t’ Parkersburg, they’s more’n two
hunderd men a-workin’ ivery day jest kapin’ up th’ track. Back there in
th’ shops, they’s foive hundred more, repairin’ an’ rebuildin’ ingines
an’ cars. At ivery little crossroads they’s an operator, an’ at ivery
little station they’s six or eight people busy at work. Out east, they
tell me, they’s a flagman at ivery crossin’. Think o’ what all that
costs!”</p>

<p>“But what’s the use of keeping the road-bed so clean?” asked Allan.
“Nobody ever sees it.”</p>

<p>“What’s th’ use o’ doin’ anything roight?” retorted Reddy. “I tell you
ivery little thing counts in favour of a road, or agin it. This here
road’s spendin’ thousands o’ dollars straightenin’ out curves over there
in th’ mountings, so’s th’ passengers won’t git shook up so much, an’
th’ trains kin make a little better toime. Why, I’ve heerd thet some
roads even sprinkle th’ road-bed with ile t’ lay th’ dust!</p>

<p>“Human natur’ ’s a funny thing,” he added, shaking his head
philosophically, “’specially when it comes t’ railroads. Many’s th’ man
Oi’ve seen nearly break his neck t’ git acrost th’ track in front of a
train, an’ thin stop t’ watch th’ train go by; an’ many another loafer,
who never does anything but kill toime, ’ll worrit hisself sick if th’
train he’s on happens t’ be tin minutes late. It’s th’ man who ain’t got
no business that’s always lettin’ on t’ have th’ most. Here comes th’
flier,” he added, as a shrill whistle sounded from afar up the road.</p>

<p>They stood aside to watch the train shoot past with a rush and roar, to
draw into the station at Wadsworth on time to the minute.</p>

<p>“That was Jem Spurling on th’ ingine,” observed Reddy, as they went back
to work. “Th’ oldest ingineer on th’ road—an’ th’ nerviest. Thet’s th’
reason he’s got th’ flier. Most fellers loses their nerve after they’ve
been runnin’ an ingine a long time, an’ a year ’r two back, Jem got sort
o’ shaky fer awhile—slowed down when they wasn’t no need of it, y’ know;
imagined he saw things on th’ track ahead, an’ lost time. Well, th’
company wouldn’t stand fer thet, ’specially with th’ flier, an’ finally
th’ train-master told him thet if he couldn’t bring his train in on
time, he’d have t’ go back t’ freight. Well, sir, it purty nigh broke
Jem’s heart.</p>

<p>“‘Oi tell y’, Mister Schofield,’ he says t’ th’ train-master, ‘Oi’ll
bring th’ train in on toime if they’s a brick house on th’ track.’</p>

<p>“‘All right,’ says Mr. Schofield; ‘thet’s all we ask,’ an’ Jem went down
to his ingine.</p>

<p>“Th’ next day Jem come into th’ office t’ report, an’ looked aroun’ kind
o’ inquirin’ like.</p>

<p>“‘Any of it got here yet?’ he asks.</p>

<p>“‘Any o’ what?’ asks Mr. Schofield.</p>

<p>“‘Any o’ thet coal,’ says Jem.</p>

<p>“‘What coal?’ asks Mr. Schofield.</p>

<p>“‘Somebody left a loaded coal-car on th’ track down here by th’ chute,’
says Jem.</p>

<p>“‘They did?’</p>

<p>“‘Yes,’ says Jem; ‘thought they’d throw me late, most likely; but they
didn’t. Oi’m not loike a man what’s lost his nerve—not by a good deal.’</p>

<p>“‘But th’ car—how’d y’ git around it?’ asks Mr. Schofield.</p>

<p>“‘Oh, Oi didn’t try t’ git around it,’ says Jem. ‘Oi jest pulled her
wide open an’ come through. They’s about a ton o’ coal on top o’ th’
rear coach, an’ Oi thought maybe I’d find th’ rest of it up here. I
guess it ain’t come down yit.’</p>

<p>“‘But, great Scott, man!’ says Mr. Schofield, ‘that was an awful risk.’</p>

<p>“‘Oi guess Oi’d better run my ingine down t’ th’ repair shop,’ went on
Jem, cool as a cucumber. ‘Her stack’s gone, an’ the pilot, an’ th’
winders o’ th’ cab are busted. But Oi got in on toime.’</p>

<p>“Well, they laid Jem off fer a month,” concluded Reddy, “but they’ve
niver said anything since about his losin’ his nerve.”</p>

<p>So, through the afternoon, Reddy discoursed of the life of the rail, and
told stories grave and gay, related tragedies and comedies, described
hair-breadth escapes, and with it all managed to impart to his hearer
many valuable hints concerning section work.</p>

<p>“Though,” he added, echoing Jack, “it’s not on section you’ll be workin’
all your life! You’ve got too good a head fer that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said Allan, modestly. “This takes a pretty good head,
too, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It takes a good head in a way; but it’s soon learnt, an’ after thet,
all a man has t’ do is t’ keep sober. But this is a, b, c, compared t’
th’ work of runnin’ th’ road. Ever been up in th’ despatcher’s office?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Allan. “I never have.”</p>

<p>“Well, y’ want t’ git Jack t’ take y’ up there some day; then y’ll see
where head-work comes in. I know thet all the trainmen swear at th’
despatchers; but jest th’ same, it takes a mighty good man t’ hold down
th’ job.”</p>

<p>“I’ll ask Jack to take me,” said Allan; and he resolved to get all the
insight possible into the workings of this great engine of industry, of
which he had become a part.</p>

<p>Quitting-time came at last, and they loaded their tools wearily upon the
car and started on the five-mile run home. This time there was no
disturbing incident. The regular click, click of the wheels over the
rails told of a track in perfect condition. At last they rattled over
the switches in the yards and pushed the car into its place in the
section-house.</p>

<p>“You run along,” said Jack to Allan. “I’ve got t’ make out a report
to-night. It’ll take me maybe five minutes. Tell Mary I’ll be home by
then.”</p>

<p>“All right!” and Allan picked up his bundle of clothes and started
across the yards. He could see the little house that he called home
perched high on its bank of clay. Apparently they were watching for him,
for he saw a tiny figure running down the path, and knew that Mamie was
coming to meet him. She did not stop at the gate, but ran across the
narrow street and into the yards toward him. He quickened his steps at
the thought that some harm might befall her among this maze of tracks.
He could see her mother standing on the porch, looking down at them,
shading her eyes with her hand.</p>

<p>And then, in an instant, a yard-engine whirled out from behind the
roundhouse. Mamie looked around as she heard it coming, and stopped
short in the middle of the track, confused and terrified in presence of
this unexpected danger.</p>

</h2>

<p>As Allan dashed forward toward the child, he saw the engineer, his face
livid, reverse his engine and jerk open the sand-box; the sand spurted
forth under the drivers, whirling madly backwards in the midst of a
shower of sparks, but sliding relentlessly down upon the terror-stricken
child. It was over in an instant—afterward, the boy could never tell how
it happened—he knew only that he stooped and caught the child from under
the very wheels of the engine, just as something struck him a terrific
blow on the leg and hurled him to one side.</p>

<p>He was dimly conscious of holding the little one close in his arms that
she might not be injured, then he struck the ground with a crash that
left him dazed and shaken. When he struggled to his feet, the engineer
had jumped down from his cab and Welsh was speeding toward them across
the tracks.</p>

<p>“Hurt?” asked the engineer.</p>

<p>“I guess not—not much;” and Allan stooped to rub his leg. “Something hit
me here.”</p>

<p>“Yes—the footboard. Knocked you off the track. I had her pretty near
stopped, or they’d be another story.”</p>

<p>Allan turned to Welsh, who came panting up, and placed the child in his
arms.</p>

<p>“I guess she’s not hurt,” he said, with a wan little smile.</p>

<p>But Jack’s emotion had quite mastered him for the moment.</p>

<p>“Mamie!” he cried, gathering her to him. “My little girl!” And the great
tears shattered down over his cheeks upon the child’s dress.</p>

<p>The others stood looking on, understanding, sympathetic. The fireman
even turned away to rub his sleeve furtively across his eyes, for he was
a very young man and quite new to railroading.</p>

<p>The moment passed, and Welsh gripped back his self-control, as he turned
to Allan and held out his great hand.</p>

<p>“You’ve got nerve,” he said. “We won’t fergit it—Mary an’ me. Come on
home—it’s your home now, as well as ours.”</p>

<p>Half-way across the tracks they met Mary, who, after one shrill scream
of anguish at sight of her darling’s peril, had started wildly down the
path to the gate, though she knew she must arrive too late. She had seen
the rescue, and now, with streaming eyes, she threw her arms around
Allan and kissed him.</p>

<p>“My brave boy!” she cried. “He’s our boy, now, ain’t he, Jack, as long
as he wants t’ stay?”</p>

<p>“That’s jest what I was tellin’ him, Mary dear,” said Jack.</p>

<p>“But he’s limpin’,” she cried. “What’s th’ matter? Y’re not hurted,
Allan?”</p>

<p>“Not very badly,” answered the boy. “No bones broken—just a knock on the
leg that took the skin off.”</p>

<p>“Come on home this instant,” commanded Mary, “an’ we’ll see.”</p>

<p>“Ain’t y’ goin’ t’ kiss Mamie?” questioned Jack.</p>

<p>“She don’t deserve t’ be kissed!” protested her mother. “She’s been a
bad girl—how often have I told her never t’ lave th’ yard?”</p>

<p>Mamie was weeping bitter tears of repentance, and her mother suddenly
softened and caught her to her breast.</p>

<p>“I—I won’t be bad no more!” sobbed Mamie.</p>

<p>“I should hope not! An’ what d’ y’ say t’ Allan? If it hadn’t ’a’ been
fer him, you’d ’a’ been ground up under th’ wheels.”</p>

<p>“I—I lubs him!” cried Mamie, with a very tender look at our hero.</p>

<p>She held up her lips, and Allan bent and kissed them.</p>

<p>“Well, m’ boy,” laughed Jack, as the triumphal procession moved on again
toward the house, “you seem t’ have taken this family by storm, fer
sure!”</p>

<p>“Come along!” cried Mary. “Mebbe th’ poor lad’s hurted worse’n he
thinks.”</p>

<p>She hurried him along before her up the path, sat him down in a chair,
and rolled up his trousers leg.</p>

<p>“It’s nothing,” protested Allan. “It’s nothing—it’s not worth worrying
about.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ain’t</i> it!” retorted Mary, with compressed lips, removing shoe and
sock and deftly cutting away the blood-stained underwear. “<i>Ain’t</i> it?
You poor boy, look at that!”</p>

<p>And, indeed, it was rather an ugly-looking wound that lay revealed. The
flesh had been crushed and torn by the heavy blow, and was bleeding and
turning black.</p>

<p>“It’s a mercy it didn’t break your leg!” she added. “Jack, you loon!”
she went on, with a fierceness assumed to keep herself from bursting
into tears, “don’t stand starin’ there, but bring me a basin o’ hot
water, an’ be quick about it!”</p>

<p>Jack <i>was</i> quick about it, and in a few moments the wound was washed and
nicely dressed with a cooling lotion which Mary produced from a
cupboard.</p>

<p>“I keep it fer Jack,” Mary explained, as she spread it tenderly over the
wound. “He’s allers gittin’ pieces knocked off o’ him. Now how does it
feel, Allan darlint?” “It feels fine,” Allan declared. “It doesn’t hurt
a bit. It’ll be all right by morning.”</p>

<p>“By mornin’!” echoed Mary, indignantly. “I reckon y’ think yer goin’ out
on th’ section t’-morrer!”</p>

<p>“Why, of course. I’ve got to go. We’re getting it ready for the Irish
Brigade. We’ve got to win that prize!”</p>

<p>“Prize!” cried Mary. “Much I care fer th’ prize! But there! I won’t
quarrel with y’ now. Kin y’ walk?”</p>

<p>“Of course I can walk,” and Allan rose to his feet.</p>

<p>“Well, then, you men git ready fer supper. I declare it’s got cold—I’ll
have t’ warm it up ag’in! An’ I reckon I’ll put on a little somethin’
extry jest t’ celebrate!”</p>

<p>She put on several things extra, and there was a regular thanksgiving
feast in the little Welsh home that evening, with Allan in the place of
honour, and Mamie looking at him adoringly from across the table.
Probably not a single one of the employés of the road would have
hesitated to do what he had done,—indeed, to risk his life for another’s
is the ordinary duty of a railroad man,—but that did not lessen the
merit of the deed in the eyes of Mamie’s parents. And for the first time
in many days, Allan was quite happy, too. He felt that he was making
himself a place in the world—and, sweeter than all, a place in the
hearts of the people with whom his life was cast.</p>

<p>But the injury was a more serious one than he had been willing to admit.
When he tried to get out of bed in the morning, he found his leg so
stiff and sore that he could scarcely move it. He set his teeth and
managed to dress himself and hobble down-stairs, but his white face
showed the agony he was suffering.</p>

<p>“Oh, Allan!” cried Mary, flying to him and helping him to a chair. “What
did y’ want t’ come down fer? Why didn’t y’ call me?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be such a nuisance as all that!” the boy protested.
“But I’m afraid I can’t go to work to-day.”</p>

<p>Mary sniffed scornfully.</p>

<p>“No—nor to-morrer!” she said. “You’re goin’ t’ stay right in that
chair!”</p>

<p>She flew around, making him more comfortable, and Allan was coddled that
day as he had not been for a long time. Whether it was the nursing or
the magic qualities of Mary’s lotion, his leg was very much better by
night, and the next morning was scarcely sore at all. The quickness of
the healing—for it was quite well again in three or four days—was due in
no small part to Allan’s healthy young blood, but he persisted in giving
all the credit to Mary.</p>

<p>After that, Allan noticed a shade of difference in the treatment
accorded him by the other men. Heretofore he had been a stranger—an
outsider. Now he was so no longer. He had proved his right to
consideration and respect. He was “th’ boy that saved Jack Welsh’s kid.”
Report of the deed penetrated even to the offices where dwelt the men
who ruled the destinies of the division, and the superintendent made a
mental note of the name for future reference. The train-master, too, got
out from his desk a many-paged, much-thumbed book, indexed from first to
last, and, under the letter “W,” wrote a few lines. The records of
nearly a thousand men, for good and bad, were in that book, and many a
one, hauled up “on the carpet” to be disciplined, had been astonished
and dismayed by the train-master’s familiarity with his career.</p>

<p>Of all the men in the gang, after the foreman, Allan found Reddy Magraw
the most lovable, and the merry, big-hearted Irishman took a great
liking to the boy. He lived in a little house not far from the Welshes,
and he took Allan home with him one evening to introduce him to Mrs.
Magraw and the “childer.” The former was a somewhat faded little woman,
worn down by hard work and ceaseless self-denial, but happy despite it
all, and the children were as healthy and merry a set of young scalawags
as ever rolled about upon a sanded floor. There were no carpets and only
the most necessary furniture,—a stove, two beds, a table, and some
chairs, for there was little money left after feeding and clothing that
ever hungry swarm,—but everywhere there was a scrupulous, almost
painful, cleanliness. And one thing the boy learned from this visit and
succeeding ones—that what he had considered poverty was not poverty at
all, and that brave and cheerful hearts can light up any home.</p>

<p>His trunk arrived from the storage house at Cincinnati in due time,
affording him a welcome change of clothing, while Mrs. Welsh set herself
to work at once sewing on missing buttons, darning socks, patching
trousers—doing the hundred and one things which always need to be done
to the clothing of a motherless boy. Indeed, it might be fairly said
that he was motherless no longer, so closely had she taken him to her
heart.</p>

<p>Sunday came at last, with its welcome relief from toil. They lay late in
bed that morning, making up lost rest, revelling in the unaccustomed
luxury of leisure, and in the afternoon Jack took the boy for a tour
through the shops, swarming with busy life on week-days, but now
deserted, save for an occasional watchman. And here Allan got, for the
first time, a glimpse of one great department of a railroad’s management
which most people know nothing of. In the first great room, the “long
shop,” half a dozen disabled engines were hoisted on trucks and were
being rebuilt. Back of this was the foundry, where all the needed
castings were made, from the tiniest bolt to the massive frame upon
which the engine-boiler rests. Then there was the blacksmith shop, with
its score of forges and great steam-hammer, that could deliver a blow of
many tons; and next to this the lathe-room, where the castings from the
foundry were shaved and planed and polished to exactly the required size
and shape; and still farther on was the carpenter shop, with its maze of
woodworking machinery, most wonderful of all, in its nearly human
intelligence.</p>

<p>Beyond the shop was the great coal chute, where the tender of an engine
could be heaped high with coal in an instant by simply pulling a lever;
then the big water-tanks, high in air, filled with water pumped from the
river half a mile away; and last of all, the sand-house, where the
sand-boxes of the engines were carefully replenished before each trip.
How many lives had been saved by that simple device, which enabled the
wheels to grip the track and stop the train! How many might be
sacrificed if, at a critical moment, the sand-box of the engine happened
to be empty! It was a startling reflection—that even upon this little
cog in the great machine—this thoughtless boy, who poured the sand into
the boxes—so much depended.</p>

<p>Bright and early Monday morning they were out again on Twenty-one.
Wednesday was inspection, and they knew that up and down those two
hundred miles of track hand-cars were flying back and forth, and every
inch of the roadway was being examined by eyes severely critical. They
found many things to do, things which Allan would never have thought of,
but which appealed at once to the anxious eyes of the foreman.</p>

<p>About the middle of the afternoon, Welsh saw a figure emerge from a
grove of trees beside the road and come slouching toward him. As it drew
nearer, he recognized Dan Nolan.</p>

<p>“Mister Welsh,” began Nolan, quite humbly, “can’t y’ give me a place on
th’ gang ag’in?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Jack, curtly, “I can’t. Th’ gang’s full.”</p>

<p>“That there kid’s no account,” protested Nolan, with a venomous glance
at Allan. “I’ll take his place.”</p>

<p>“No, you won’t, Dan Nolan!” retorted Jack. “He’s a better man than you
are, any day.”</p>

<p>“He is, is he?” sneered Nolan. “We’ll see about that!”</p>

<p>“An’ if you so much as harm a hair o’ him,” continued Jack, with
clenched fists, “I’ll have it out o’ your hide, two fer one—jest keep
that in mind.”</p>

<p>Nolan laughed mockingly, but he also took the precaution to retreat to a
safe distance from Jack’s threatening fists.</p>

<p>“Y’ won’t give me a job, then?” he asked again.</p>

<p>“Not if you was th’ last man on earth!”</p>

<p>“All right!” cried Nolan, getting red in the face with anger, which he
no longer made any effort to suppress. “All right! I’ll fix you an’ th’
kid, too! You think y’re smart; think y’ll win th’ section prize! Ho,
ho! I guess not! Not this trip! Purty section-foreman you are! I’ll show
you!”</p>

<p>Jack didn’t answer, but he stopped and picked up a stone; and Nolan
dived hastily back into the grove again.</p>

<p>“He’s a big coward,” said Jack, throwing down the stone disgustedly, and
turning back to his work. “Don’t let him scare y’, Allan.”</p>

<p>“He didn’t scare me,” answered Allan, quietly, and determined to give a
good account of himself should Nolan ever attempt to molest him.</p>

<p>But Jack was not as easy in his mind as he pretended; he knew Nolan, and
believed him quite capable of any treacherous meanness. So he kept Allan
near him; and if Nolan was really lurking in the bushes anywhere along
the road, he had no opportunity for mischief.</p>

<p>The next morning Jack took his men out directly to the western end of
the section, and came back very slowly, stopping here and there to put a
finishing touch to the work. Even Reddy was enthusiastic over the
condition of the section.</p>

<p>“It’s foin as silk!” he said, looking back over the road they had just
traversed. “Ef we don’t git th’ prize this toime, it’s because some
other feller’s a lot smarter ’n we are!”</p>

</h2>

<p>Engineer Lister had often been angry in his life, for, truth to tell,
running an engine is not conducive to good nerves or even temper. It is
a trying job, demanding constant alertness, and quick, unerring
judgment. But when to the usual responsibilities of the place are added
a cranky engine and a green fireman, even a saint would lose his
patience. Ellis Root was the green fireman, and seemed to possess such a
veritable genius for smothering his fire that more than once the
engineer had been compelled to clamber down from his box and wield the
rake and shovel himself. To add to this difficulty of keeping up steam,
the 226, a great ten-wheeled aristocrat of a freight-engine, had
suddenly developed a leaky throttle, together with some minor ailments,
which rendered the task of handling her one of increasing difficulty.</p>

<p>The last straw was the refusal of the despatcher at headquarters to
allow Lister to reduce his tonnage. His train happened to be an
unusually heavy one which, ordinarily, the 226 could have handled with
ease. The despatcher knew this; he knew also that Lister had an
unfortunate habit of complaining when there was nothing to complain
about; so when this last complaint came in, he wired back a terse reply,
telling Lister to “shut up, and bring in your train.”</p>

<p>So Lister was raving angry by the time his engine limped feebly into the
yards at Wadsworth. He jumped off almost before she stopped, and leaped
up the stairs to the division offices two steps at a time, in order to
unburden himself without delay of his opinion of the despatcher who had
so heartlessly refused to help him out of his difficulties.</p>

<p>He burst into the office like a whirlwind, red in the face, gasping for
breath.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Lister?” asked the train-master, looking up from his
desk.</p>

<p>“Matter!” yelled Lister. “Where’s that thick-headed despatcher? He ain’t
fit to hold a job on this road!”</p>

<p>“What did he do?” asked the train-master, grinning at the heads that had
been stuck in from the adjoining rooms to find out what the noise was
about. “Tell me what he did, and maybe I’ll fire him.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what he did! He made me handle my full train when I wired
in here an’ told him my engine was leakin’ like a sieve. What do you
think of a roundhouse foreman that’ll send an engine out in that shape?”</p>

<p>“So you want me to fire the foreman, too?” queried the train-master,
grinning more broadly. “Where is the engine?”</p>

<p>“She’s down there in the yards,” said Lister.</p>

<p>“What! Down in the yards! Do you mean to say you brought her in?”</p>

<p>“Of course I brought her in,” said Lister. “They ain’t another engineer
on th’ road could ’a’ done it, but I did it, an’ I want to tell you, Mr.
Schofield—”</p>

<p>A succession of sharp blasts from the whistle of the yard-engine
interrupted him.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried the train-master, and threw up the window, for the
blasts meant that an accident of some sort had happened. The other men
in the office rushed to the windows, too,—they saw the yardmen running
madly about and gesticulating wildly,—and away up the yards they saw the
226 rattling over the switches at full speed, running wild!</p>

<p>With a single bound the train-master was at the door of the despatcher’s
office.</p>

<p>“Where’s Number Four?” he demanded. Number Four was the fastest through
passenger-train on the road—the east-bound flier, to which all other
trains gave precedence.</p>

<p>The despatcher in charge of the west end of the road looked up from his
desk.</p>

<p>“Number Four passed Anderson three minutes ago, sir,” he said. “She’s on
time—she’s due here in eight minutes.”</p>

<p>The train-master’s face grew suddenly livid; a cold sweat burst out
across his forehead.</p>

<p>“Good Lord!” he murmured, half to himself. “A wreck—no power on earth
can help it!”</p>

<p>A vision danced before his eyes—a vision of shattered cars, of mangled
men and women. He knew where the collision must occur; he knew that the
flier would be coming down that heavy grade at full speed—and toward the
flier thundered that wild engine—with no guiding hand upon the
throttle—with nothing to hold her back from her mad errand of
destruction!</p>

<hr class='tbk' />

<p>It had happened in this wise. A moment after Engineer Lister jumped to
the ground, and while his fireman, Ellis Root, was still looking after
him with a grin of relief, for the trip had been a hot one for him in
more ways than one, a yardman came along and uncoupled the engine from
the train. The fireman began to kick off his overalls, when he became
suddenly conscious that the engine was moving. The leaky throttle did
not shut off the steam completely from the cylinders, and, released from
the weight of the heavy train which had held her back, the engine
started slowly forward.</p>

<p>The fireman, whose knowledge of the engine was as yet of the most
primitive description, sprang to the other side of the cab and pushed
the lever forward a notch or two. The engine’s speed increased.</p>

<p>“I can’t stop her,” he said, feverishly, half to himself. “I can’t stop
her,” and he pulled the lever back.</p>

<p>The engine sprang back in answer and bumped heavily into the train
behind her.</p>

<p>“Hi, there, you ijit!” yelled the yardman, who was under the first car
inspecting the air-hose. “What you mean? D’ y’ want t’ kill a feller?
Let that ingine alone!”</p>

<p>Ellis, with the perspiration trickling down his face, threw the lever
forward again, and then, as the engine bounded forward in answer, he
lost his head entirely and leaped off, with a wild yell of dismay.</p>

<p>In a moment the 226 rattled over the switches westward out of the yards,
and shot out upon the main track, gathering speed with every revolution!</p>

<p>Welsh’s gang had worked its way eastward along the section as far as the
mill switch, when the foreman took out his watch and glanced at it.</p>

<p>“Git that hand-car off th’ track, boys,” he said. “Number Four’ll be
along in a minute.”</p>

<p>Two of the men derailed the hand-car, while Welsh glanced up and down
the road to be sure that the track was clear, and took a look at the
mill switch, a little distance away, where they had been working, to
make certain that it had been properly closed. He remembered that a
work-train had taken a cut of cars out of the switch a short time
before, but he could tell by the way the lever was thrown that the
switch was closed.</p>

<p>Far in the distance he could hear the train whistling for the curve just
beyond the cut. Then, suddenly from the other direction, he caught a
sound that brought him sharply round, and saw with horror a great
freight-engine rumbling rapidly toward him.</p>

<p>“My God, she’s runnin’ wild!” he cried; and, with a yell of warning to
his men, turned and ran toward the switch. If he could only get there in
time to ditch her!</p>

<p>But the engine whirled past him, and he stopped, seeing already the
horror, the destruction, which must follow in a moment. Then, far ahead,
he saw Reddy speeding toward the switch, saw him reach it, bend above
the short lever that controlled it, and throw it over. Away up the track
the “flier” flashed into view, running a mile a minute. He could guess
what was happening in her cab, as her engineer saw the danger. The heavy
engine rumbled on, all too slowly now, in upon the switch to knock the
bumper at the farther end to splinters and fight her life out in the mud
beyond. He saw Reddy throw the lever back again, only in that instant to
be hurled away to one side as the great train swept by in safety. And
the engineer, who had reversed his lever and applied the brakes, who had
waited the outcome with white face and tight-set lips,—but who, never
for an instant, had thought of saving himself by jumping,—released the
brakes and threw his lever again on the forward motion. Four minutes
later the train swept in to Wadsworth, only forty seconds behind the
schedule!</p>

<p>The passengers never knew how near they had been to death—by what a
miracle they had escaped destruction! After all, a miss is as good as a
mile!</p>

<p>Reddy’s comrades found him lying unconscious twenty feet from the track.
His right arm—the arm that had thrown the lever—hung limp by his side,
and there was a great gash in his head from which the blood was pouring.
In a moment Jack had torn off the sleeve of his shirt and made an
improvised bandage of it, which checked to some extent the flow of
blood.</p>

<p>“We must git him home,” said Welsh, “where we kin git a doctor. He’s
hurted bad. Git th’ car on th’ track, boys.”</p>

<p>In an instant it was done, and Reddy was gently lifted on.</p>

<p>“Now you set down there an’ hold his head, Allan,” said Jack. “Keep it
as stiddy as y’ kin.”</p>

<p>Allan sat down obediently and placed the mangled head tenderly in his
lap. As he looked at the pale face and closed eyes, it was all he could
do to keep himself from breaking down. Poor Reddy—good old Reddy—a hero,
Allan told himself, with quickening heart, a hero who had not hesitated
to risk his life for others.</p>

<p>But they were off!</p>

<p>And how the men worked, pumping up and down until the car fairly flew
along the track. They knew the way was clear, since the flier had just
passed, and up and down they pumped, up and down, knowing that a few
minutes might mean life or death to their comrade. Down the grade they
flashed, along the embankment by the river, through the town and into
the yards, where a dozen willing hands lifted the inanimate form from
the car and bore it tenderly into the baggage-room.</p>

<p>“How did it happen, Welsh?” asked the train-master, after a surgeon had
been summoned and an ambulance had taken the still unconscious Reddy to
his home.</p>

<p>And Jack told him, while the train-master listened, with only a little
nod now and then to show that he understood. At the end he drew a deep
breath.</p>

<p>“I thought the flier was gone for sure,” he said. “It would have been
the worst wreck in the history of the road. Thank God it was spared us!”</p>

<p>“Yes, thank God,” said Jack, a little hoarsely; “but don’t fergit t’
thank Reddy Magraw, too!”</p>

<p>“We won’t!” said the train-master, with another little nod. “We’ll never
forget Reddy.”</p>

<p>“More especially,” added Jack, a little bitterly, “since it’s not th’
first time he’s saved th’ road a bad wreck. He was fergot th’ first
time!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” agreed the train-master. “But he wouldn’t have been if
I’d had anything to do with it.”</p>

<p>“I know it, sir,” said Jack, heartily. “I know it, Mr. Schofield. You’ve
always treated us square. But I couldn’t help rememberin’!”</p>

<p>Half an hour later Allan and Jack intercepted the doctor as he came out
of the little house where Mrs. Magraw sat with her apron over her head,
rocking back and forth in agony.</p>

<p>“He’ll be all right, won’t he, doctor?” asked Jack, anxiously. “He ain’t
a-goin’t’ die?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the doctor, “he’ll not die. But,” and he hesitated, “he
got a mighty bad crack, and it will be a long time before he’s able to
be out again.”</p>

<p>“He’s come to all right, ain’t he, doctor?” questioned Jack, seeing the
doctor’s hesitation.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s conscious again, but he’s not quite himself yet. But I think
he’ll come around all right,” and the doctor walked briskly away, while
Jack and Allan, assured that they could do nothing more for Reddy or his
family, whom the neighbours had parcelled out among themselves, went
slowly home.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER VII.</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>THE IRISH BRIGADE</span>
</h2>

<p>It was not until they were seated around the table that evening that
Allan remembered that the next day was to occur the great inspection by
the Irish Brigade, and he straightened up suddenly as he thought of it.</p>

<p>“Didn’t that engine tear things up some when she ran off the track?” he
asked of Jack.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered the foreman, “but it was only at th’ end of th’ sidin’,
an’ that won’t matter. Besides, th’ wreckin’ crew’s up there now gittin’
th’ engine back on th’ track an’ fixin’ things up ag’in. If th’ main
line on Twenty-one ain’t in good shape, it’s because I don’t know what
good shape is,” he added, with decision. “We couldn’t do anything more
to it if we worked fer a week. I’ve asked th’ boys t’ take a run over it
t’-morrer mornin’ jest as a matter o’ precaution. Do y’ think y’ kin git
up at midnight?” he added, suddenly, giving his wife a knowing wink.</p>

<p>“At midnight?” repeated Allan. “Why, yes, of course, if you want me to.”</p>

<p>“Well, y’ll have t’ git up at midnight if y’ want t’ ketch Number Five
fer Cincinnati.”</p>

<p>Allan’s face flushed with quick pleasure.</p>

<p>“Am I to go, too?” he asked, eagerly. “Can you take me, too?”</p>

<p>Jack laughed in sympathy with his bright eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said; “that’s what I kin. I got an extry pass from th’
superintendent. I told him I had a boy who wanted t’ see th’ road
because he was goin’ t’ be superintendent hisself, some day. He said he
guessed he knew th’ boy’s name without bein’ told, an’ wrote out th’
pass.”</p>

<p>Allan flushed high with pleasure.</p>

<p>“That was nice of him,” he said.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jack; “an’ yet I think he was figgerin’ on helpin’ th’ road,
too. Y’ see, whenever a bright feller like you comes along an’ shows
that he’s steady an’ can be depended on, he never gits t’ work on
section very long. They need boys like that up in th’ offices. That’s
where th’ brains o’ th’ road are. In fact, th’ office itself is th’
brain o’ th’ whole system, with wires runnin’ out to every part of it
an’ bringin’ back word what’s goin’ on, jest like a doctor told me once
th’ nerves do in our bodies.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Allan; “but what has that got to do with my going over the
road to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Jest this,” said Jack; “before a feller’s fit to hold a job in th’
offices,—a job as operator or despatcher, that is,—and work one o’ them
little wires, he’s got t’ know th’ road better’n he knows th’ path in
his own back yard. He’s got t’ know every foot of it—where th’ grades
are an’ how heavy they are; where th’ curves are, an’ whether they’re
long or short; where every sidin’ is, an’ jest how many cars it’ll hold;
where th’ track runs through a cut, an’ where it comes out on a fill;
where every bridge and culvert is—in fact, he’s got t’ know th’ road so
well that when he’s ridin’ over it he kin wake up in th’ night an’ tell
by th’ way th’ wheels click an’ th’ cars rock jest exactly where he is!”</p>

<p>At the moment Allan thought that Jack was exaggerating; but he was to
learn that there was in all this not the slightest trace of
exaggeration. And he was to learn, too, that upon the accuracy of this
minute knowledge the safety of passenger and freight train often
depended.</p>

<p>They sat on the porch again that evening, while Mary rocked Mamie to
sleep and Jack smoked his pipe. Always below them in the yards the
little yard-engines puffed up and down, placing the cars in position in
the trains—cars laden with coal and grain for the east; cars laden with
finished merchandise for the west; the farmer and miner exchanging his
product for that of the manufacturer.</p>

<p>Only there was no Reddy to come and whistle at the gate, and after
awhile they walked over to his house to find out how he was.</p>

<p>Mrs. Magraw let them in. Her stout Irish optimism had come back again,
for Reddy was better.</p>

<p>“Though he’s still a little quare,” she added. “He lays there with his
oies open, but he don’t seem t’ notice much. Th’ docther says it’ll be a
day or two afore he’s hisself ag’in.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad it’s no worse,” said Jack. “We can’t afford to lose
Reddy.”</p>

<p>“We won’t lose him this trip, thank God!” said Mrs. Magraw. “Mr.
Schofield was over jist now t’ see if they was anything he could do. He
says th’ road’ll make it all roight with Reddy.”</p>

<p>“That’s good!” said Jack, heartily; “but we won’t keep you any longer,
Mrs. Magraw,” and he and Allan said good night.</p>

<p>“We must be gittin’ t’ bed ourselves,” Jack added, as they mounted the
path to his home. “Remember, we have t’ git up at midnight. It’s good
an’ sleepy you’ll be, my boy!”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t!” laughed Allan. “But I’ll turn in now, anyway.”</p>

<p>It seemed to him that he had been asleep only a few minutes when he
heard Jack’s voice calling. But he was out of bed as soon as he got his
eyes open, and got into his clothes as quickly as he could in the
darkness. Mary had a hot lunch waiting by the time he got down-stairs.
He and Jack ate a little,—one doesn’t have much appetite at
midnight,—and together they made their way across the yards to the
station, where they caught the fast mail for the city.</p>

<p>The smoking-car of the train was crowded with section-men on their way
to the rendezvous, and a jolly, good-natured lot they were. There was no
thought of sleep, for this was a holiday for them,—besides, sleep was
out of the question in that tumult,—and one story of the rail followed
another. As Allan listened, he wondered at these tales of heroism and
daring told so lightly—of engineers sticking to their posts though
certain death stared them in the face; of crossing-flagmen saving the
lives of careless men and women, at the cost, often, of their own; of
break-in-twos, washouts, head-end collisions, of confusion of orders and
mistakes of despatchers—all the lore that gathers about the life of the
rail. And as he listened, the longing came to him to prove himself
worthy of this brotherhood.</p>

<p>One story, in particular, stuck in Allan’s memory.</p>

<p>“Then there was Tom Rawlinson,” began one of the men.</p>

<p>“Let Pat tell that story,” interrupted another. “Come out here, Pat. We
want t’ hear about Tom Rawlinson an’ his last trip on th’
Two-twenty-four.”</p>

<p>So Pat came out, shyly, a tall, raw-boned man. As he got within the
circle of light, Allan saw that his face was frightfully scarred.</p>

<p>“’Twas in th’ summer o’ ninety-two,” he began. “Rawlinson had had th’
Two-twenty-four about a month, an’ was as proud of her as a man is of
his first baby. That day he was takin’ a big excursion train in to
Parkersburg. He was lettin’ me ride in th’ cab, which he hadn’t any
bus’ness t’ do, but Tom Rawlinson was th’ biggest-hearted man that ever
pulled a lever on this road.”</p>

<p>He paused a moment, and his listeners gravely nodded their approval of
the sentiment.</p>

<p>“Well, he was pullin’ up th’ hill at Torch, an’ th’ engine had on every
pound she could carry. There was a big wind whistlin’ down th’ cut, an’
we could hear th’ fire a-roarin’ when th’ fireman pulled open th’ door
t’ throw in some more coal. Th’ minute th’ door was open, the wind jest
seemed t’ sweep int’ thet fire-box, an’ the first thing I knew, a big
sheet o’ flame was shootin’ right out in my face. I went back over that
tender like a rabbit, without stoppin’ t’ argy th’ why an’ th’
wherefore, an’ when I got back t’ th’ front platform o’ th’ baggage-car,
I found that Tom an’ his fireman had come, too.</p>

<p>“We stood there a minute, hardly darin’ t’ breathe, a-watchin’ thet
fire. It licked out at th’ cab, an’ quicker’n I kin tell it, th’ wood
was blazin’ away in great shape. Then, all of a sudden, I happened t’
think o’ somethin’ that sent a cold chill down my back, an’ made me sick
an’ weak. Here was we poundin’ along at forty miles an hour, with orders
t’ take th’ sidin’ fer Number Three at th’ Junction, five mile ahead. It
looked to me as though they’d be about a thousand people killed inside
of a mighty few minutes.”</p>

<p>He stopped to take a fresh chew of tobacco, and Allan saw that his hands
were trembling at the memory of that fearful moment.</p>

<p>“Well,” he continued, “as I was a-sayin’, I could feel my hair a-raisin’
right up on my head. I looked around at Tom, an’ I could tell by his set
face that he was thinkin’ of th’ same thing I was.</p>

<p>“‘Boys,’ he says, low-like, ‘I’m goin’ forrerd. I’ve got to shet her
off. I hadn’t no business t’ run away.’</p>

<p>“An’ without waitin’ fer either o’ us t’ answer, forrerd he went,
climbin’ over th’ coal an’ down into th’ burnin’ cab. It was like goin’
into a furnace, but he never faltered—right on he went—right on into th’
fire—an’ in a minute I felt th’ jerk as he reversed her an’ threw on th’
brakes. It seemed t’ me as though we’d never come to a stop, but we did,
an’ then th’ brakeman an’ me went forrerd over th’ coal t’ git Tom out.
But it warn’t no use. He was layin’ dead on his seat, still holdin’ to
th’ throttle.</p>

<p>“We lifted him down, an’ by that time th’ conductor an’ a lot o’ th’
passengers come a-runnin’ up. An’ then folks begun tellin’ me my face
was burned,” and Pat indicated his scars with a rapid gesture. “Till
then, I’d never even felt it. When y’re in it, y’ know, y’ only feel it
fer others, not fer yourself.”</p>

<p>That ended the story-telling. There was something in that tale of
sacrifice which made other tales seem idle and empty.</p>

<p>The dawn was just tingeing the sky in the east when the train rushed
into the great, echoing train-shed at Cincinnati. The men got out and
hurried forward to the dining-room, where a lunch of coffee and
sandwiches awaited them. Here, too, were the train-master and division
superintendent, trim-built, well-groomed men, with alert eyes, who knew
the value of kind words and appreciative criticism when it came to
managing men. Lunch was hastily eaten, and then the whole crowd
proceeded to the special inspection train, where it stood on the
side-track ready to start on its two hundred mile trip eastward. And a
peculiar looking train it was—consisting, besides the engine, of only
one car, a tall, ungainly, boarded structure, open at one end, and,
facing the open end, tiers of seats stretching upward to the roof.</p>

<p>Into this the men poured and took their seats, so that every one could
see the long stretch of track as it slid backward under them. Almost at
once the signal came to start, and the gaily decorated engine—draped
from end to end in green, that all might know it was the “Irish Brigade”
out on its inspection tour—pulled out through the “ditch,” as the deep
cut within the city limits is called, past the vast stock-yards and out
upon the level track beyond. Instantly silence settled upon the car,
broken only by the puffing of the engine and the clanking of the wheels
over the rails. Seventy pairs of eyes were bent upon the track, the
road-bed, the right of way, noting every detail. Seventy pairs of ears
listened to the tale the wheels were telling of the track’s condition.
It was a serious and solemn moment.</p>

<p>Allan, too, looked out upon all this, and his heart fell within him.
Surely, no track could be more perfect, no road-bed better kept. It must
be this section which would win the prize. Yet, when that section had
been left behind and the next one entered on, he could detect no
difference. How could anybody rate one section higher than another, when
all alike were perfect? And what possible chance was there for
Twenty-one?</p>

<p>They were side-tracked at the end of an hour to allow a through
passenger to pass, and the babel of voices arose again. But it was
silenced at once the moment they ran out to continue on the journey.
Hours passed, and at last, with a leaping heart, Allan recognized the
west end of Section Twenty-one. He glanced at Jack Welsh, and saw how
his eyes were shining, but he dared not look in his direction a second
time. He stared out at the track and wondered if it was really here that
he had laboured for the past week.</p>

<p>Yes,—he recognized the landmarks,—the high trestle over the deep ravine,
the cut, the long grade, the embankment along the river. It seemed
almost that he knew every foot of the track; but he did not know it so
well as he thought, for his eyes did not detect what Welsh’s more
critical ones saw on the instant,—traces of gravel dug out, of whitewash
rubbed away, of a guard-fence broken down. The gravel had been replaced,
the whitewash touched up anew, the fence had been repaired, but Welsh
knew that the section was not as he had left it the night before, and in
a flash he understood.</p>

<p>“It was some of Dan Nolan’s work,” he said to himself, and, the moment
the train stopped in the yards at Wadsworth, he called to Allan and
hurried away to the section-shanty to hear the story.</p>

</div>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='chVIII' title='VIII: GOOD NEWS AND BAD'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER VIII.</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>GOOD NEWS AND BAD</span>
</h2>

<p>His men were waiting for him, as he knew they would be, and the story
was soon told. They had started out in the morning, according to his
instructions, for a last run over the section, and soon discovered the
work of the enemy. Ties which had been piled neatly at the side of the
right of way had been thrown down, whitewashed boulders around the
mile-posts had been torn up, in many places holes had been dug in the
road-bed,—in short, the section was in a condition which not only would
have lost them the prize, but would have brought unbearable disgrace
upon their foreman.</p>

<p>They set to work like Trojans righting the damage, for they knew they
had only a few hours, beginning at the western end and working slowly
back toward the city. More than once it seemed that they could not get
through in time; but at last the work was done, just as the whistle of
the inspection train sounded in the distance.</p>

<p>“An’ mighty well done,” said Jack, approvingly, when the story was
ended. “You’ve done noble, m’ boys, an’ I won’t fergit it! Th’ section’s
in as good shape as it was last night.”</p>

<p>“But what dirty criminal tore it up?” asked one of the men.</p>

<p>“I know who it was,” and Jack reddened with anger. “It was that loafer
of a Dan Nolan. He threatened he’d git even with me fer firin’ him, but
I didn’t pay no attention. I didn’t think he’d got that low! Wait till I
ketch him!”</p>

<p>And his men echoed the threat in a tone that boded ill for Daniel.</p>

<p>“Come on, Allan, we’ve got t’ be gittin’ back,” said Jack. “An’ thank y’
ag’in, boys,” and together he and Allan turned back toward the waiting
train.</p>

<p>Section Twenty-one was the last inspected before dinner, which was
awaiting them in the big depot dining-room at Wadsworth. The officers
came down from division headquarters to shake hands with the men as they
sat grouped about the long tables, and good-natured chaff flew back and
forth. But at last the engine-bell announced that the green-decked train
was ready to be off again eastward, over the last hundred miles of the
division, which ended at Parkersburg.</p>

<p>The men swarmed into their places again, and silence fell instantly as
the train started, rattling over the switches until it was clear of the
yards, then settling into a regular click, click, as it swung out upon
the main line. It must be confessed that this portion of the trip had
little interest for Allan. The monotony of it—mile after mile of track
gliding steadily away—began to wear upon him. He was no expert in
track-construction, and one stretch of road-bed looked to him much like
every other. So, before long, he found himself nodding, and, when he
straightened up with a jerk and opened his eyes, he found Jack looking
at him with a little smile.</p>

<p>They ran in upon a siding at Moonville to make way for a
passenger-train, and Jack, beckoning to Allan, climbed out upon the
track.</p>

<p>“I kin see you’re gittin’ tired,” said Jack, as they walked up and down,
stretching their legs. “I ought to let you stop back there at Wadsworth.
But mebbe I kin give y’ somethin’ more interestin’ fer th’ rest o’ th’
trip. How’d y’ like t’ ride in th’ engine?”</p>

<p>Allan’s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p>“Do you think I might?” he asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>Jack laughed.</p>

<p>“I thought that’d wake y’ up! Yes,—we’ve got Bill Higgins with us on
this end, an’ I rather think he’ll let you ride in th’ cab. Let’s find
out.”</p>

<p>So they walked over to where the engineer was “oiling round,” in
railroad parlance—going slowly about his engine with a long-spouted
oil-can in one hand and a piece of waste in the other, filling the
oil-cups, wiping off the bearings, feeling them to see if they were too
hot, crawling under the boiler to inspect the link motion—in short,
petting his engine much as one might pet a horse.</p>

<p>“Bill,” began Jack, “this is Allan West, th’ boy thet I took on section
with me.”</p>

<p>Bill nodded, and looked at Allan with friendly eyes.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “I’ve heerd o’ him.”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Jack, “he’s gittin’ purty tired ridin’ back there with
nothin’ t’ do but watch th’ track, an’ I thought mebbe you’d let him
ride in th’ cab th’ rest o’ th’ trip.”</p>

<p>“Why, sure!” agreed Bill, instantly. “Climb right up, sonny.”</p>

<p>Allan needed no second invitation, but clambered up and took his place
on one of the long seats which ran along either side of the cab. Right
in front of him was a narrow window through which he could see the track
stretching far ahead to meet the horizon. Below him was the door to the
fire-box, into which the fireman was at that moment shovelling coal. At
his side, mounted on the end of the boiler, was a maze of gauges, cocks,
wheels, and levers, whose uses he could not even guess.</p>

<p>The engineer clambered up into the cab a moment later, glanced at the
steam and water gauges, to see that all was right, and then took his
place on his seat. He got out his “flimsy”—the thin, manifolded
telegraphic train order from headquarters, a copy of which had also been
given to the conductor—and read it carefully, noting the points at which
he was to meet certain trains and the time he was expected to make to
each. Then he passed it over to his fireman, who also read it, according
to the rules of the road. One man might forget some point in the orders,
but it was not probable that two would.</p>

<p>There came a long whistle far down the line, and Allan saw the through
passenger train leap into view and came speeding toward them. It passed
with a rush and a roar, and a minute later the conductor raised his
hand. The engineer settled himself on his seat, pushed his lever
forward, and opened the throttle gently, pulling it wider and wider as
the engine gathered speed. Never for an instant did his glance waver
from the track before him—a moment’s inattention might mean death for
him and for the men entrusted to his care.</p>

<p>There was something fascinating in watching the mighty engine eat up
mile after mile of track. There were other things to watch, too. At
every crossing there was the danger of an accident, and Allan was
astonished at the chances people took in driving across the track,
without stopping to look up and down to see if there was any danger.
Deep in talk they were sometimes, until roused by a fierce blast from
the whistle; or sometimes the curtains of the buggy hid them entirely
from view. And although the right of way was private ground and
carefully fenced in on either side, there were many stragglers along
it,—a group of tramps boiling coffee in a fence corner, a horse or cow
that had managed to get across a cattle-guard, children playing
carelessly about or walking the rails in imitation of a tight-rope
performer. All these had to be watched and warned of their danger. Never
once did the engineer lift his hand from the throttle, for that gave him
the “feel” of the engine, almost as the reins give the driver the “feel”
of a spirited horse. Now and then he glanced at the steam-gauge, but
turned back instantly to watch the track ahead.</p>

<p>Nor was the fireman idle. His first duty was to keep up steam, and he
noted every variation of the needle which showed the pressure, shaking
down his fire, and coaling up, as occasion demanded; raking the coal
down from the tender, so as to have it within easy reach; sweeping off
the “deck,” as the narrow passage from engine to tender is called; and
occasionally mounting the seat-box to ring the bell, as they passed
through a little village.</p>

<p>Allan began to understand the whistle signals—especially the two long
and two short toots which are the signal for a crossing, the signal most
familiar to travellers and to those who live along the line of a
railroad. And he grew accustomed to the rocking of the engine, the
roaring of the fire, the sudden, vicious hiss of steam when the engineer
tested a cock, the rush of the wind and patter of cinders against the
windows of the cab. He began to take a certain joy in it—in the noise,
the rattle, the motion. There was an excitement in it that made his
pulses leap.</p>

<p>So they hummed along, between broad fields, through little hamlets and
crossroads villages, mile after mile. Operators, flagmen, and
station-agents came out to wave at them, here and there they passed a
section-gang busy at work, now and then they paused until a freight or
passenger could thunder past—on and on, on and on. Allan looked out at
field and village, catching glimpses of men and women at work, of
children at play—they would turn their faces toward him, and in another
instant were gone. The life of the whole country was unfolded before
him,—everywhere there were men and women working, everywhere there were
children playing,—everywhere there was life and hope and happiness and
sorrow. If one could only go on like this for ever, visiting new scenes,
seeing new—</p>

<p>A sharp, sudden, agonized cry from the fireman startled him out of his
thoughts, and he felt the quick jolt as the engineer reversed his engine
and applied the brakes. For a moment, in the shrieking, jolting
pandemonium that followed, he thought the engine was off the track;
then, as he glanced ahead, his heart suddenly stood still. For there,
toddling down the track toward the engine, its little hands uplifted,
its face sparkling with laughter, was a baby, scarce old enough to walk!</p>

<p>As long as he lives Allan will never forget that moment. He realized
that the train could not be stopped, that that little innocent, trusting
life must be ground out beneath the wheels. He felt that he could not
bear to see it, and turned away, but just then the fireman sprang past
him, slammed open the little window, ran along the footboard, clambered
down upon the pilot, and, holding to a bolt with one hand, leaned far
over and snatched the little one into the air just as the engine bore
down upon it. Allan, who had watched it all with bated breath, fell back
upon his seat with a great gasp of thankfulness.</p>

<div id='f112' style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-left:10.0%; width:80%;'>
  <img src='images/facing112.jpg' alt='' style='width:100%' />
<p class='caption'>“SNATCHED THE LITTLE ONE INTO THE AIR JUST AS THE ENGINE BORE DOWN UPON IT”</p>
</div>

<p>The engine stopped with a jerk, the fireman sprang to the ground with
the baby in his arms. It was still crowing and laughing, and patting his
face with its hands. Allan, looking at him, was surprised to see the
great tears raining down his cheeks and spattering on the baby’s
clothes.</p>

<p>“It’s his kid,” said the engineer, hoarsely. “He lives up yonder,” and
he nodded toward a little house perched on the hillside that sloped down
to the track. “That’s th’ reason th’ kid was down here—he come down t’
see his daddy!”</p>

<p>The section-men came pouring forward to find out what was the matter,
and surrounded the baby as soon as they heard the story, petting him,
passing him around from hand to hand—until, suddenly, the mother, who
had just missed him, came flying down the hill and snatched him to her
breast.</p>

<p>“Pile back in, boys,” called the conductor, cutting short the scene. “We
can’t stay here all day. We’ve got t’ make Stewart in eighteen minutes.”</p>

<p>They hurried back to their places, the engineer, stopping only to give
his fireman a hearty grip of the hand, opened the throttle. This time
they were off with a jump—lost time had to be made up, and in a moment
they were singing along at a speed which seemed positively dangerous.
The engine rocked back and forth, and seemed fairly to leap over the
rails; the wind whistled around them; the fire roared and howled in the
fire-box. Eighteen minutes later, they pulled in to the siding at
Stewart, on time to the second.</p>

<p>Allan had had enough of riding in the cab, and, thanking the engineer,
and shaking hands with the fireman, he climbed down and took his seat
again in the inspection-car. But he was very tired, and soon nodded off
to sleep, and it was not until the train stopped and a sudden clamour of
talk arose that he started fully awake.</p>

<p>The men were handing in their reports to the superintendent, who, with
the assistance of the train-master, was going over them rapidly to find
out which section had received the most points. Zero was very bad; ten
was perfection. There were no zeros on any of the seventy reports,
however; and, let it be added, not many tens.</p>

<p>The moments passed as the train-master set down in a column under each
section the number of points it had received. Then he added up the
columns, the superintendent looking over his shoulder. They compared the
totals for a moment, and then, with a smile, the superintendent took
from his pocket a check upon which the name only was lacking, and filled
it in. Then he turned to the expectant men.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” he began, “I think this company has cause to be
congratulated on the condition of its road-bed. A vote of seven hundred,
as you know, would mean perfection, and yet, not a single section has
fallen below six hundred. The highest vote for any one section is 673,
and that vote is given for Section Twenty-one, of which John Welsh is
foreman. Mr. Welsh, will you please come forward and get your check?”
and he fluttered the paper in the air above his head.</p>

<p>A great burst of cheering broke forth again and again. They were
generous men, these section-foremen of the Irish Brigade, and, seeing
how all thought of self was forgotten, Allan’s eyes grew suddenly misty.
Not a man there who seemed to feel the bitterness of the vanquished. But
as Allan glanced over to Jack, who was making his way over the seats and
stopping to return hand-shakes right and left, a cheer on his own
account burst from the boy’s lips, and he tossed his cap wildly in the
air.</p>

<p>“Good for ye, lad!” cried one of the men, slapping the boy on his back.
“Give him a cheer! That’s right. Give him another cheer!” and Allan was
lifted to the shoulders of one of the brawny men, who cried: “This is
the b’y that saved Jack Welsh’s colleen, worth more than a prize to Jack
Welsh! Give the b’y a cheer!”</p>

<p>And the men responded with a will!</p>

<p>A moment later and they settled down again, as they saw the
superintendent was waiting for their attention.</p>

<p>“Welsh,” began that official, when quiet was restored, “you’re a good
man, and I’m glad that you got the prize. But,” he added, looking around
over the crowd, “you’re not the only good man in the Irish Brigade. The
only thing I’m sorry for is that I can’t give a prize to every man here.
I’m like the Dodo in ‘Alice in Wonderland’—I think you’ve all won, and
that you all ought to have prizes. I want to thank you every one for
your good work. I’m not overstating things a bit when I say that this
division is in better shape than any other on the road. We’ve had fewer
accidents, and we’ve run our trains closer to the schedule than any
other—all of which is largely due to your good work. I’m proud of my
Irish Brigade!”</p>

<p>They cheered him and clapped him, and every man there resolved to do
better work, if possible, in the coming year than he had done in the
past one.</p>

<p>And yet there were some of the officials in the far-distant general
offices at Baltimore who wondered why the superintendent of the Ohio
division was so popular with his men!</p>

<hr class='tbk' />

<p>Jack came to Allan at last and gripped his hand with a strength that
proved how deep his emotion was.</p>

<p>“Come on,” he said. “We’re goin’ home on Number Seven. It’ll start in a
minute.”</p>

<p>They went together across the tracks and clambered into the coach. Allan
caught a confused picture of a glare of lights and laughing people
crowding past. But hardly had the train started when his head fell back
against the seat, and slumber claimed him.</p>

<p>Jack waked him up at the journey’s end, and together they hurried
through the yards and up the steep path to the little cottage. Jack’s
wife was awaiting him in the doorway, and he drew forth the check and
placed it in her hands.</p>

<p>“We won,” he said, softly. “’Twas fer you, Mary, I wanted t’ win. It
means th’ new dress you’ve been a-needin’ so long, an’ a dress fer
Mamie; yes, an’ a new carpet.”</p>

<p>The wife said not a single word, but drew Jack’s face down to hers and
kissed it.</p>

<p>“Only,” he added, when his head was lifted, “I want t’ give tin dollars
of it t’ th’ boys—I’d ’a’ lost if it hadn’t been fer them. An’
Reddy—how’s old Reddy?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jack!” she cried, her eyes suffused with sudden tears, her lips
a-tremble, “it’s too terrible! He’s come to, but he don’t remember
nothin’—not a thing! He don’t know anybody—not even his own wife, Jack,
nor th’ childer, an’ th’ doctor says that maybe he never will!”</p>

</h2>

<p>As time went on, it became more and more evident that the doctor’s
prediction with regard to Reddy Magraw was to be fulfilled. He regained
his strength, but the light seemed quite gone from his brain. The
officials of the railroad company did all they could for poor Reddy.
When the local doctors failed, they brought an eminent specialist from
Cincinnati for consultation, but all seemed to agree there was nothing
to be done but to wait. There was one chance in a thousand that a
surgical operation might prove of benefit, but there was just as great a
chance that Nature herself might do the work better.</p>

<p>Reddy remembered nothing of his past life. More than this, it gradually
became evident to his friends that his genial nature had undergone a
change through the darkness that had overtaken his brain. He grew
estranged from his family, and strangely suspicious of some of his
friends, those to whom he had really been most attached. Among these
last was Allan. He would have nothing whatever to do with the boy.</p>

<p>“It’s one of the most ordinary symptoms of dementia,” the doctor had
explained, when Jack questioned him about it. “Aversion to friends is
what we always expect. His wife feels it more keenly than you do.”</p>

<p>“Of course she does, poor woman!” agreed Jack. “But he hasn’t got to
abusin’ her, sir, has he?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no; he doesn’t abuse her; he just avoids her, and shows his dislike
in other ways. If he begins to abuse her, we’ll have to send him to
the asylum. But I don’t anticipate any violence—I think he’s quite
harmless.”</p>

<p>It was while they were sitting on the porch one evening discussing the
sad situation of their friend, that Allan turned suddenly to Jack.</p>

<p>“Do you remember,” he said, “that first noon we were talking together,
you started to tell me of some brave thing Reddy had done, and he shut
you off?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Jack nodded; “I remember.”</p>

<p>“Tell me now, won’t you? I’d like to hear about it.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Jack, and told the story. Here it is:</p>

<p>Six years before, Reddy Magraw had been one of the labourers at the big
coal-chute which towered into the air at the eastern end of the yards;
just an ordinary labourer, working early and late, as every labourer for
a railroad must, but then, as always, happy and care-free.</p>

<p>It was one afternoon in June that a message flashed into the
despatcher’s office which sent the chief despatcher headlong into the
office of the superintendent.</p>

<p>“The operator at Baker’s just called me up, sir,” he gasped, “to report
that second Ninety-seven ran through there, going forty miles an hour,
and that the engineer dropped a message tied to a wrench saying his
throttle-valve had stuck, and his brakes wouldn’t work, and that he
couldn’t stop his engine!”</p>

<p>The superintendent started to his feet, his face livid.</p>

<p>“They’ll be here in eight minutes,” he said. “Where’s Number Four?”</p>

<p>“Just past Roxabel. We can’t catch her, and the freight will run into
her sure if we let it through the yards.”</p>

<p>“We won’t let it through the yards,” said the superintendent, and went
down the stairs three steps at a time, and sped away in the direction of
the coal-chute.</p>

<p>He had reflected rapidly that if the freight could be derailed at the
long switch just below the chute, it could be run into a gravel bank,
where it would do much less damage than farther up in the yards, among
the network of switches there. He ran his swiftest, but as he reached
the chute, he heard, far down the track, the roar of the approaching
train. Evidently it was not yet under control. Reddy Magraw heard the
roar, too, and straightened up in amazement. Why should a freight
approach the yards at that speed? Then he saw the superintendent tugging
madly at the switch.</p>

<p>“Thet switch won’t work, sir,” he said. “A yard ingine hit the p’int
about an hour ago an’ jammed it.”</p>

<p>“Won’t work!” echoed the superintendent, and stared blankly down the
track at the train which every second was whirling nearer.</p>

<p>“Is it a runaway?” asked Reddy, suddenly understanding.</p>

<p>“Yes,—a runaway,—maybe I can make the other switch,” and he started
away, but Reddy caught him by the arm.</p>

<p>“Wait, sir,” he cried; “wait. We’ll fix ’em—throw ’em on to th’ chute.”</p>

<p>“On to the chute?”</p>

<p>“Yes, on to th’ chute. Throw th’ switch there,” and Reddy, grabbing up
two big cans of oil, started for the track leading to the long ascent.</p>

<p>Then the superintendent understood, and, with a gasp of relief, ran to
the switch and threw it.</p>

<p>Up the steep ascent ran Reddy, a can in either hand, spurting streams of
oil upon the rails—up and up—yet it seemed that he must certainly be
caught and hurled to death, for a moment later the great freight-engine
reached the structure, which groaned and trembled under this
unaccustomed weight. Up the incline it mounted, the weight of the train
behind it urging it on. Half-way up, two-thirds, almost upon Reddy,
where he bent over the rails, a can in either hand, never pausing to
look back.</p>

<p>From under the pounding drivers the smoke flew in clouds—the oil was
being burned by friction. Yet down the rails flowed more oil; the
drivers were sliding now, the speed of the train was
lessening—lessening. The engine was racking itself out, its power was
spent, it had been conquered. For an instant it hung poised on the
incline, then slowly started down again. The crew had managed to set the
hand-brakes, and these held the train somewhat, but still it coasted
back down that incline at a speed that brought the watchers’ hearts into
their throats. The wheels held the rails, however, and a quarter of a
mile back on the main line it stopped, its power for evil exhausted. And
just then Number Four whistled for signal, and rumbled slowly into the
other end of the yards. The superintendent drew a deep breath of relief
and thankfulness as he thought of what the result would have been had
the runaway not been stopped in time.</p>

<p>“Was Reddy hurt?” asked Allan, who had listened to the story
breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Hurt? Oh, no; he come down th’ chute, put th’ empty oil-cans back in
their places, an’ went t’ work ag’in.”</p>

<p>“But didn’t the company do something for him?” persisted the boy.
“Wasn’t he rewarded?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Jack, puffing away at his pipe with a very grim face; “but
th’ superintendent was promoted.”</p>

<p>“The superintendent?”</p>

<p>“Yes; he got his promotion. Y’ see, in his report of th’ accident, he
somehow fergot t’ mention Reddy.”</p>

<p>Allan flushed with a sudden generous anger.</p>

<p>“But,” he began, “that wasn’t—”</p>

<p>“Honest?” and Jack laughed a little bitterly. “No, maybe not; but what
could a poor feller like Reddy do about it? Only,” he added, “it’s jest
as well fer that superintendent he didn’t stay on this division. Th’
boys would ’a’ given him some mighty lively times. We’ve got a gentleman
fer a superintendent now. He don’t try t’ stale nobody else’s
thunder—he’s given Reddy a square deal this time.”</p>

<p>Truth to tell, Reddy’s family was being better provided for than it had
ever been—the superintendent saw to that; and Reddy himself was
receiving the best medical attention to be secured, though it seemed
more and more certain that even the greatest skill would be unable to
restore his memory.</p>

<p>It was long before sleep came to Allan’s eyes that night, so excited was
he over Jack’s story of Reddy’s exploit, and so indignant at the
injustice that had been done him. He was thinking about it still, next
day, until, of a sudden, he was forcibly reminded that he also possessed
an enemy who was watching eagerly for an opportunity to injure him, and
who would pause at no treachery.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER X.</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>A SUMMONS IN THE NIGHT</span>
</h2>

<p>This reminder came that very afternoon while he was working at the
bottom of the deep cut through the spur of the hill which marked the top
of the long, stiff grade just west of the mill switch.</p>

<p>The other members of the gang were at the farther end of the cut, and
Allan had just finished levelling down a pile of gravel, when he heard a
sudden shout of warning from Jack.</p>

<p>“Look out, Allan!” cried the latter. “Look out!”</p>

<p>Allan instinctively sprang aside, and was just in time to escape a large
boulder which came crashing down the side of the cut.</p>

<p>Allan gazed at it in astonishment, drawing a deep breath at his escape.
Then he saw Jack, followed by the others, charging madly up the side of
the hill. Without stopping to reason why, he followed.</p>

<div id='f128' style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-left:10.0%; width:80%;'>
  <img src='images/facing128.jpg' alt='' style='width:100%' />
<p class='caption'>“JUST IN TIME TO ESCAPE A LARGE BOULDER”</p>
</div>

<p>“What’s the matter?” he cried, as he came panting up behind the ones who
had just gained the hilltop.</p>

<p>“Matter!” cried Jack, glaring around to right and left over the
hillside. “Matter enough! What d’ y’ suppose made that rock fall that
way?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said Allan, looking around bewildered, “the earth under it must
have given way—”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” interrupted the foreman, impatiently. “Look, here’s th’ hole
it left. Th’ earth didn’t give way a bit. Y’ kin see th’ rock was pried
out—yes, an’ here’s th’ rail that was used to do it with. Now, who d’ y’
suppose had hold of that rail?”</p>

<p>Allan turned a little giddy at the question.</p>

<p>“Not Dan Nolan?” he said, in an awed whisper.</p>

<p>“Who else but Dan Nolan. An’ he’s hidin’ down there in one o’ them
gullies, sneakin’ along, keepin’ out o’ sight, or I’m mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Did you see him?” asked Allan.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t see him,” retorted Jack. “If I’d seen him, I’d have him in
jail afore night, if I had t’ hunt this whole county over fer him. But I
know it was him. Who else could it be? You know he’s threatened y’. He’s
been hangin’ around doggin’ y’ ever since I put y’ at this job. There’s
more’n one of us knows that; an’ there’s more’n one of us knows, too,
that he wouldn’t be above jest this kind o’ work. He lamed a man on my
gang, onct, jest because he had a grudge ag’in him—dropped th’ end of a
rail on his foot an’ mashed it so bad that it had t’ be taken off. He
said it was an accident, an’ I believed him, fer I didn’t know him as
well then as I do now. He wouldn’t stop at murder, Dan Nolan
wouldn’t—why, that rock would ’a’ killed you in a minute, if it had hit
you!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I believe it would,” said Allan, and he shivered a little at the
thought of his narrow escape.</p>

<p>Jack took another long look around at the hills and valleys, but if
Nolan was anywhere among them, the trees and underbrush hid him
effectually. And Allan was loth to believe Jack’s theory; bad as Nolan
was, it seemed incredible that he should be so savage, so cold-blooded,
as to lie there on the brink of the precipice, waiting, moment by
moment, until his victim should be in the precise spot where the rock
would strike him. That seemed too fiendish for belief.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t like to think Nolan did it,” he said, a little hoarsely,
“unless I had some proof. You didn’t see him, you know—”</p>

<p>“See him!” echoed Jack. “No—I didn’t need to see him! There’s th’ hole
th’ stone was pried out of, an’ there’s th’ rail that was used fer a
lever. Now who had hold o’ that rail? Ain’t Nolan th’ only enemy you’ve
got in th’ world?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Allan, in a low voice; “yes, I believe he is.”</p>

<p>“An’ do you suppose a feller would lay fer you like that unless he had
somethin’ ag’in you? I tell you, Dan Nolan’s hidin’ down there in the
bushes somewhere, an’ lookin’ up here at us an’ swearin’ because he
didn’t git you!” and Jack shook his fist impatiently at the horizon. “If
I had him under my heel, I’d kill him like I would a snake!”</p>

<p>Which, of course, Jack wouldn’t have done, but his honest Irish blood
was boiling at this moment, and he said more than he meant.</p>

<p>“Come on, boys,” he added, calming himself by a mighty effort, “we can’t
ketch him now, but we’ll git th’ scoundrel yet!” and he started down the
hill, a savage scowl still on his face.</p>

<p>The incident had cast a shadow over the spirits of the gang, and they
worked the rest of the afternoon in silence. Indeed, ever since Reddy’s
accident, the gang had lacked that spirit of optimism and gaiety which
had marked it; a new man had been taken on, but while he did Reddy’s
work fairly well, he could not take Reddy’s place in the hearts of the
men. Their day’s work lacked the savour which Reddy’s wit had given it,
and they went home at night more weary than had been their wont. Jack
saw, too, that their work had lost some of its alacrity, and yet he had
no heart to find fault with them.</p>

<p>But he took no more chances of Allan’s suffering any treacherous injury.
He had talked the matter over with his wife, and between them, they had
laid out a plan of action. Whenever possible, Jack kept Allan near him.
When that was not possible, he took care that the boy should not be
alone at any spot where his enemy could sneak up on him from behind. He
knew if the boy was injured through any carelessness or lack of
foresight on his part, he would never dare to go home again and face his
wife!</p>

<p>All of this was, of course, plain enough to Allan, and chafed him
somewhat, for he did not want the rest of the gang to think him a baby
who needed constant looking after. Besides, he had an honest reliance on
his ability to look after himself. So, one day, he ventured to protest.</p>

<p>“See here, Jack,” he said, “I’m not afraid of Dan Nolan. In fact, I
think I’d be rather glad of the chance to meet him in a fair stand-up
fight.”</p>

<p>“An’ that’s just th’ chance he’ll never give ye,” retorted Jack. “I
wouldn’t be afeerd o’ him, either, if he’d fight fair—I believe y’ could
lick him. But he won’t fight fair. Th’ coward’ll hit y’ from behind, if
he kin—an’ he’s waitin’ his chance. That’s his kind, as y’ ought t’ know
by this time. Oh, if I could only ketch him!”</p>

<p>But since the afternoon that great rock had fallen, Nolan had utterly
disappeared from his accustomed haunts. Jack made diligent inquiries,
but could get no news of him. The gang of scalawags who were his usual
companions professed to be utterly ignorant of his whereabouts. He had
been sleeping in a little closet back of one of the low railroad
saloons, paying for board and lodging by cleaning out the place every
morning, but the proprietor of the place said he had not been near there
for a week. So at last Jack dropped his inquiries, hoping against hope
that Nolan had taken alarm and left the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Reddy continued to improve physically from day to day, but mentally he
grew worse and worse. His broken arm had healed nicely, and the wound in
his head was quite well, but the injury to the brain baffled all the
skill of his physicians. He would sit around the house, moping,
seemingly taking notice of nothing; then he would suddenly start up and
walk rapidly away as though he had just remembered some important
engagement. Frequently he would be gone all day, sometimes even all
night. He was rarely at home at meal-times, and yet he never seemed to
be hungry.</p>

<p>Mrs. Magraw could never find out from him where he spent all this time.
He refused to answer her questions, until, seeing how they vexed him,
she ceased from bothering him, and let him go his own way. Of her bitter
hours of despair and weeping, she allowed him to see nothing, but tried
always to present to him the same cheerful and smiling countenance she
had worn in the old days before his injury. In spite of this, he grew
more and more morose, more and more difficult to get along with. The
doctor advised that he be taken to an asylum, but the very word filled
his wife with a nameless dread, and she prayed that he might be left in
her care a little while longer. Perhaps he might grow better; at any
rate, unless he grew worse, she could look after him.</p>

<p>One morning, about a week after the attempt upon Allan’s life, he and
Jack were working together on the embankment by the river’s edge, when
the foreman stopped suddenly, straightened himself, and, shading his
eyes with his hand, gazed long and earnestly across the water. Allan,
following his look, saw two men sitting by a clump of willows, talking
earnestly together. Their figures seemed familiar, but it was not until
one of them leaped to his feet, waving his arms excitedly, that he
recognized him as Reddy Magraw.</p>

<p>“Who is the other one?” he asked.</p>

<p>“It’s Dan Nolan,” said the foreman between his teeth. “What deviltry d’
y’ suppose he’s puttin’ int’ that poor feller’s head?”</p>

<p>Allan did not answer, but a strange foreboding fell upon him as he
watched Reddy’s excited oratory. Then the two watchers saw Nolan
suddenly pull Reddy down, and together they vanished behind the trees.</p>

<p>What could it mean? Allan asked himself. What villainy was Dan Nolan
plotting? Was he trying to make poor, half-witted Reddy his instrument
for the commission of some crime?</p>

<p>Jack, too, worked away in unaccustomed silence and unusual heaviness of
heart, for he was asking himself the same questions. Something must be
done; Reddy must not be led into any mischief; and no influence which
Nolan might gain over him could be anything but bad. It was like the
coward to try to get another man to do what he himself shrank from
doing.</p>

<p>The morning passed and noon came, but neither Jack nor Allan had relish
for their dinner—the incident of the morning had spoiled their
appetites.</p>

<p>“We’ll have t’ look out after Reddy some way,” said Jack, at last, and
then fell silent again.</p>

<p>They were soon back at work, and Allan, busy with his thoughts, did not
notice that the air grew chill and the sky overcast.</p>

<p>“The’ll be a storm t’-night,” observed Jack at last, looking around at
the sky.</p>

<p>“’Fore night,” said one of the workmen. “We’ll be havin’ to quit work
purty soon.”</p>

<p>Even to an unpractised eye, the signs were unmistakable. Down from the
north great banks of black clouds were sweeping, and the wind felt
strangely cold, even for the last days of October. At last came the
swift patter of the rain, and then a swirl of great, soft, fleecy
flakes.</p>

<p>“Snow!” cried Jack. “Well, ’f I ever!”</p>

<p>All stopped to watch the unaccustomed spectacle of snow in October. It
fell thick and fast, the flakes meeting and joining in the air into big
splotches of snow, which melted almost as soon as it touched the ground.
Two of the men, who had been blotted from sight for a moment, came
hurrying toward the others.</p>

<p>“We might as well quit,” said Jack. “We can’t work this kind o’
weather;” and so they started homeward through the storm, an hour before
the usual time.</p>

<p>As the evening passed, the storm grew heavier and more violent. Looking
out from the window after supper, Allan found that the whole world was
shut from sight behind that swirling white curtain. From time to time he
could hear the faint rumble of a train in the yards below, but no gleam
of the engine’s headlight penetrated to him.</p>

<p>“It’s a bad night fer railroadin’,” Jack remarked, looking out beside
him. “A bad night. Th’ rails ’r so slippy th’ wheels can’t grip ’em, an’
th’ engineer might as well shut his eyes fer all th’ good his headlight
does him. An’ th’ brakeman—fancy runnin’ along th’ two-foot path on the
top of a train in a storm like this!”</p>

<p>But trainmen cannot stop for wind or weather, darkness or stress of
storm, and the trains rumbled in and out through the night, most of them
behind time, to be sure, but feeling their way along as best they could,
while up in the offices the despatchers, with tense nerves and knitted
brows, struggled to maintain order in the midst of chaos. The wires were
working badly, every train on the road was behind the schedule; out at
some of the little stations, the operators, unused to the strain, were
growing nervous. The superintendent closed his desk with a bang, after
dictating the last letter; but instead of going home, as usual, he stood
around with his hands in his pockets, listening to the wildly clicking
instruments, and chewing a cigar savagely.</p>

<p>Allan lay for a long time that night listening to the trains, thinking
of the wonderful system by which the great business was managed. He
could understand, as yet, only a little of this system, and he was
hungering to know more. Then the scene of the morning came back to him,
and he tossed from side to side, thinking of it. Poor Reddy—yes, he
needed looking after if Dan Nolan had got hold of him. Reddy’s mind was
more that of a child than of a man at present. What an evil influence
Dan might have over him if he cared to use it!</p>

<p>At last sleep came; but in an instant he was back again at the river
bank peering across at the figures on the other side. They were talking
together; they seemed to be quarrelling. Then, suddenly, Nolan caught
the other by the throat and hurled him backward over the bank into the
water. Reddy sank with a wild cry; then his head reappeared, and he
caught a glimpse of the boy standing on the farther bank.</p>

<p>“Allan!” he cried, stretching out his arms imploringly. “Allan!”</p>

<p>Allan sat bolt upright, rubbing his eyes, straining his ears to hear the
call again.</p>

<p>“Allan!”</p>

<p>It was Jack’s voice,—he knew it now,—but the dawn was not peeping in at
the window, as was usual when Jack called him. He realized that the
night had not yet passed. He caught a glimmer of yellow light under his
door and heard Jack putting on his boots in the room below.</p>

<p>Fully awake at last, he sprang out of bed and opened the door.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he called down the stair. “Do you want me?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Hurry up,” answered Jack’s voice.</p>

<p>Allan threw on his clothes with trembling hands, and hastened
down-stairs. He found Jack already at table, eating hastily.</p>

<p>“Set down,” said the latter, “an’ fill up. It’s mighty uncertain when
ye’ll git another square meal.”</p>

<p>“We’re going out?” asked the boy. “Then there’s a wreck?”</p>

<p>“Yes, a wreck—freight, near Vinton. Th’ caller jest come fer me. It’s so
bad all th’ section-gangs on this end ’r ordered out. Eat all y’ kin.
Better drink some coffee, too. Y’ll need it.”</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XI.</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>CLEARING THE TRACK</span>
</h2>

<p>Allan did his best to force himself to eat, but the strangeness of the
hour and the excitement of the promised adventure took all desire for
food from him. He managed, however, to drink a cup of coffee, but his
hands were trembling so with excitement he could scarcely hold the cup.
It was a wreck, and a bad one. How terrible to lose a moment! He was
eager to be off. But Jack knew from experience the value and need of
food while it could be obtained, in view of what might be before them.</p>

<p>“It’ll take ’em some time t’ git’ th’ wreckin’-train ready,” he said.
“Git our waterproofs, Mary.”</p>

<p>But Mary had them waiting, as well as a lot of sandwiches. She had been
through such scenes before.</p>

<p>“There, stuff your pockets full,” she said to Allan. “You’ll want ’em.”</p>

<p>Jack nodded assent, and took his share.</p>

<p>“And now, good-bye, Mary,” said Jack. “No, don’t wake the baby. If we
git back by t’-morrer night, we’ll be lucky. Come on, Allan.”</p>

<p>The snow was still falling heavily as they left the house, and they made
their way with some difficulty to the corner of the yards where the
wrecking-train stood on its spur of siding. A score of section-men had
already gathered, and more were coming up every minute. Nobody knew
anything definite about the wreck—some one had heard that Bill Miller,
the engineer, was hurt. It seemed they were taking a doctor along, for
Allan saw his tall form in the uncertain light. And the train-master and
division superintendent were with him, talking together in low tones.</p>

<p>Jack began checking off his men as they came up and reported.</p>

<p>An engine backed up and coupled on to the wrecking-train, and the men
slowly clambered aboard. The switch at the end of the siding was opened.</p>

<p>“How many men have you got, Welsh?” asked Mr. Schofield, the
train-master.</p>

<p>“Thirty-six, so far, sir.”</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll pick up the gangs on Twenty-three and four as we pass.
Go ahead,” he shouted to the engineer. “We’ve got a clear track to
Vinton,” and he followed Allan and Jack up the steps into the car.</p>

<p>There was a hiss of steam into the cylinders and the train pulled slowly
out upon the main track, the wheels slipping over the rails at first,
but gripping better as the train gathered headway and shot eastward into
the whirling snow. Operators, switchmen, station-agents, flagmen, all
looked out to see it pass. It had only two cars—one, a long flat car
loaded with ties and rails, piled with ropes and jacks and crowbars. At
one end stood the heavy steel derrick, strong enough to lift even a
great mogul of a freight-engine and swing it clear of the track.</p>

<p>In the other car, which looked very much like an overgrown box-car, was
the powerful donkey-engine which worked the derrick, more tools, a
cooking-stove, and a number of narrow cots. Two oil-lanterns swung from
the roof, half-illuminating the faces of the men, who sat along the
edges of the cots, talking together in low tones.</p>

<p>At Byers, the section-gang from Twenty-three clambered aboard; at Hamden
came the gangs from Twenty-four and Twenty-five. Nearly sixty men were
crowded together in the car; but there was little noise. It reminded
Allan of a funeral.</p>

<p>And it was a funeral. The great railroad, binding East to West, was
lying dead, its back broken, useless, its circulation stopped. The line
was blocked, the track torn up—it was no longer warm, living, vital. It
had been torn asunder. It was a mere useless mass of wood and steel.
These men were hastening to resurrect it, to make it whole again.</p>

<p>At McArthur the superintendent came aboard with a yellow paper in his
hand,—the conductor’s report of the accident,—and he and the
train-master bent their heads together over it. The men watched them
intently.</p>

<p>“Is it a bad one, sir?” asked Jack at last.</p>

<p>“Bad enough,” answered the superintendent. “It seems that first
Ninety-eight broke in two on the grade just beyond Vinton. Track so
slippery they couldn’t hold, and she ran back into the second section.
They came together in the cut at the foot of the grade, and fifteen cars
loaded with nut coal were wrecked. Miller seems the only one hurt, but
the track’s torn up badly.”</p>

<p>“Nut coal!” said Jack, with a whistle. “We’ve got our work cut out for
us, boys.”</p>

<p>The men nodded—they knew now what to expect. And they fell to talking
together in low tones, telling stories of past wrecks, of feats of
endurance in the breathless battle which always follows when this
leviathan of steel is torn asunder. But the superintendent had used one
word which Allan had not wholly understood, and he took the first
opportunity to ask Jack about it.</p>

<p>“What did Mr. Heywood mean, Jack,” he inquired, “when he said the train
broke in two?”</p>

<p>“That’s so,” and Jack laughed. “It’s your first one—I’d forgot that. I
wish it was mine,” and he forthwith explained just how the accident had
probably happened.</p>

<p>A “break-in-two” occurs usually as a train is topping a heavy grade. The
unusual strain breaks a coupling-pin or pulls out a draw-bar, and the
portion of the train released from the engine goes whirling back down
the grade, carrying death and destruction with it, unless the crew can
set the brakes and get it stopped. Or, on a down-grade, a coupling-pin
jumps out and then the two sections come together with a crash, unless
the engineer sees the danger in time, and runs away at full speed from
the pursuing section. It is only freights that “break in two,” for
passenger couplings are made heavy enough to withstand any strain;
besides, the moment a passenger-train parts, the air-brakes
automatically stop both sections. But to freight crews there is no
danger more menacing than the “break-in-two,” although, happily, this
danger is gradually growing less and less, with the introduction of
air-brakes on freight-cars as well as passenger.</p>

<p>Freight-trains, when traffic is heavy, are usually run in sections, with
as many cars to each section as an engine can handle. The sections are
run as close together as they can be with safety, and, in railroad
parlance, the first section of Freight-train Ninety-eight, for instance,
is known as “first Ninety-eight”; the second section as “second
Ninety-eight,” and so on.</p>

<p>In this instance, the first section of Train Ninety-eight had broken in
two at the top of a long grade, and fifteen coal-cars, together with the
caboose, had gone hurtling back down the grade, finally crashing into
the front end of the second section, which was following about a mile
behind. The conductor and brakemen, who were in the caboose, after a
vain attempt to stop the runaway cars with the hand-brakes, had jumped
off, and escaped with slight bruises, but the engineer and fireman of
the second section had had no warning of their danger until the cars
swept down upon them out of the storm. There was no time to jump—it
would have been folly to jump, anyhow, since the high walls of the cut
shut them in on either side; yet the fireman had escaped almost unhurt,
only the engineer being badly injured. The impact of the collision had
been terrific, and, as the telegram from the conductor stated, fifteen
cars had been completely wrecked.</p>

<p>So much the section-men understood from the superintendent’s brief
description, and Jack explained it to Allan, while the others listened,
putting in a word of correction now and then.</p>

<p>On and on sped the wrecking-train through the night. The oil-lamps
flared and flickered, throwing a yellow, feeble light down into the car,
where the men sat crowded together, for the most part silent now,
figuring on the task before them. It was evident that it would be no
easy one, but they had confidence in their officers,—the same confidence
that soldiers have in a general whose ability has been fully tested,—and
they knew that the task would be made as easy as might be.</p>

<p>The atmosphere of the car grew close to suffocation. Every one, almost,
was smoking, and the lamps soon glowed dimly through the smoke like the
sun upon a foggy day. Outside, the snow still fell, thickly, softly;
their engineer could not see the track twenty feet ahead; but the
superintendent had told him that the way was clear, so he kept his
throttle open and plunged blindly on into the night, for every moment
was valuable now; every nerve must be strained to the utmost tension
until the task of clearing the track had been accomplished.</p>

<p>So the fireman bent steadily to the work of keeping up steam, clanging
the door of the fire-box back and forth between each shovelful of coal,
in order to keep the draught full strength. The flames licked out at him
each time the door was opened, lighting the cab with yellow gleams,
which danced across the polished metal and illumined dimly the silent
figure of the engineer peering forward into the storm. The engine rocked
and swayed, the wind swirled and howled about it, and tried to hold it
back, but on and on it plunged, never pausing, never slackening. Any one
who was on the track to-night must look out for himself; but, luckily,
the right of way was clear, crossing after crossing was passed without
accident; the train tore through little hamlets, awakening strange
echoes among the darkened houses, and, as it passed, the operator would
run out to look at it, and, after a single glance, would rush back to
his key, call frantically for “G I,”—the despatcher’s office,—and tick
in the message that the wrecking-train had got that far on its journey.</p>

<p>Back in the wrecking-car the superintendent had taken out his watch and
sat with it a moment in his hand.</p>

<p>“We’re going a mile a minute,” he remarked to the train-master. “Higgins
is certainly hitting her up.”</p>

<p>The train-master nodded and turned again to the conductor’s report. He
was planning every detail of the battle which must be fought.</p>

<p>Jack glanced at Allan, and smiled.</p>

<p>“You’re wonderin’ how he could tell how fast we’re going, ain’t ye?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Allan, “I am. How did he tell?”</p>

<p>“By listenin’ t’ th’ click o’ th’ wheels over th’ rails,” answered Jack.
“Each rail’s thirty foot long—that is, there’s a hundred an’ seventy-six
to th’ mile. Mister Heywood probably kept tab on them fer fifteen
seconds and counted forty-four clicks, so he knowed we was goin’ a mile
a minute.”</p>

<p>“Here we are,” remarked the train-master, as the wheels clanked over a
switch, and, sure enough, a moment later their speed began to slacken.</p>

<p>Jack looked down at Allan and grinned again, as he saw the astonishment
written on the boy’s face.</p>

<p>“You’re wonderin’ how Mr. Schofield could tell that, ain’t you?” he
asked. “Why, bless you, he knows this here division like a book. Put him
down on any part of it blindfolded and he’ll tell you right where he is.
He knows every foot of it.”</p>

<p>Perhaps Jack exaggerated unconsciously, but there was no doubt that Mr.
Schofield, like every other good train-master, knew his division
thoroughly—the location of every switch, the length of every siding, the
position of every signal, the capacity of every engine. Nay, more, he
knew the disposition of every conductor and engineer. When Milliken, for
instance, wired in a protest that he couldn’t take another load, he
would smile placidly and repeat his previous orders; if Rogers made the
same complaint, he would wire back tersely, “All right.” He knew that
Milliken was always complaining, while Rogers never did without cause.
He knew his track, his equipment, and his men—and that is, no doubt, the
reason why, to-day, he is superintendent of one of the most important
divisions of the system.</p>

<p>The wrecking-train slowed and stopped, and the men clambered painfully
to the ground, and went forward to take a look at the task before them.
It was evident in a moment that it was a bigger one than any had
anticipated—so big, indeed, that it seemed to Allan, at least, that it
would be far easier to build a new track around the place than to try to
open the old one. From side to side of the deep cut, even with the top,
the coal was heaped, mixed with splintered boards and twisted iron that
had once been freight-cars. High on the bank perched the engine, thrown
there by the mighty blow that had been dealt it. On either side were
broken and splintered cars, and the track was torn and twisted in a way
that seemed almost beyond repair. It was a scene of chaos such as the
boy had never before witnessed, and even the old, tried section-men were
staggered when they looked at it. It seemed impossible that anything so
puny as mere human strength could make any impression upon that tangled,
twisted mass.</p>

<p>The doctor hurried away to attend to the injured engineer, who had been
removed to the caboose by the crew of the second section, while the
officers went forward to look over the battle-field. At the end of three
minutes they had prepared their plan of action, and the men responded
with feverish energy. Great cables were run out and fastened to the
shattered frames of the coal-cars, which were dragged out of the mass of
wreckage by the engine, and then hoisted from the track and thrown to
one side out of the way. The donkey-engine puffed noisily away, while
the derrick gripped trucks and wheels and masses of twisted iron and
splintered beams, and swung them high on the bank beside the road with
an ease almost superhuman. The men went to work with a will, under the
supervision of the officers, dragging out the smaller pieces of
wreckage. Hour after hour they toiled, until, at last, only the coal
remained—a great, shifting, treacherous mass—ton upon ton—fifteen
car-loads—a veritable mountain of coal. And here the derrick could be of
no use—there was only one way to deal with it. It must be shovelled from
the track by hand!</p>

<p>It was a task beside which the labours of Hercules seemed small by
comparison. But no one stopped to think about its enormousness—it had to
be done, and done as quickly as possible. In a few moments, sixty
shovels were attacking the mighty mass, rising and falling with a dogged
persistence which, in the end, must conquer any obstacle.</p>

<p>Dawn found the men at this trying work. At seven o’clock hot coffee and
sandwiches were served out to them, and they stopped work for ten
minutes to swallow the food. At eight, a cold rain began to fall, that
froze into sleet upon the ground, so that the men could scarcely stand.
Still they laboured doggedly on. Train-master and superintendent were
everywhere, encouraging the men, making certain that not a blow was
wasted, themselves taking a hand now and then, with pick or shovel.
There was no thought of rest; human nature must be pushed to its utmost
limit of endurance—this great leviathan of steel and oak must be made
whole again. All along its two hundred miles of track, passengers were
waiting, fuming, impatient to reach their destinations; thousands of
tons of freight filled the sidings, waiting the word that would permit
it to go forward. Here in the hills, with scarcely a house in sight, was
the wound that stretched the whole system powerless—that kept business
men from their engagements, wives from husbands, that deranged the plans
of hundreds; ay, more than that, it was keeping food from the hungry,
the ice was melting in refrigerator-cars, peaches and apples were
spoiling in hot crates, cattle were panting with thirst,—all waiting
upon the labours of this little army, which was fighting so valiantly to
set things right.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XII.</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>UNSUNG HEROES</span>
</h2>

<p>Allan laboured savagely with the others. One thought sang in his brain,
keeping time to the steady rise and fall of the shovels: “The track must
be cleared; the track must be cleared.” The great pile of coal before
him took on a hideous and threatening personality—it was a dragon, with
its claws at the road’s throat. It must be conquered—must be dragged
away. From time to time he stopped a moment to munch one of the
sandwiches, not noticing the dirt and coal-dust that settled upon it. He
was not hungry, but he felt instinctively that he must eat the food.</p>

<p>Most of the other men were chewing tobacco, their jaws working
convulsively in unison with their arms. They had long since ceased to be
human beings—they had become machines. Their movements were precise,
automatic, regular. Their faces grew gradually black and blacker in the
perpetual dust which arose from the coal; their eyes became rimmed with
black, and bloodshot under the constant irritation of the dust. They
breathed it in, swallowed it, absorbed it. Their sense of smell and
taste gradually left them—or, at least, they could smell and taste only
one thing, coal-dust. They ceased to resemble men; one coming upon them
unawares would have taken them for some horrible group from Dante’s
inferno, doing terrible penance through eternity. They looked neither to
the right nor left; their eyes were always on the coal—on this shifting
black monster with which they were doing battle. Their hands seemed
welded to the shovels, which rose and fell, rose and fell.</p>

<p>The cold rain beat in sheets around them, soaking their clothes, and yet
they scarcely felt this added discomfort, so intent were they upon the
task before them. Most of them had thrown off their coats at the
beginning of the struggle, and now their wet shirts stuck tightly to
their skins, showing every muscle. Gradually, by almost imperceptible
degrees, the pile of coal on the banks of the cut grew higher; gradually
the pile on the track grew less, but so slowly that it was agonizing.</p>

<p>Above them on the bank, the great locomotive, hurled there and turned
completely around by the force of the collision, stood a grim sentinel.
It was the one piece of luck, the officers told themselves, in
connection with this wreck, that the engine had been tossed there out of
the way. To have raised it from the track and placed it there would have
taken hours, and every minute was so precious! It would take hours to
get it down again, but that need not be done until the track was clear.</p>

<p>Toward the middle of the morning, three fresh gangs of men came from the
east and fell to work beside the others. But the others did not think of
stopping. Instead, with staring eyes and tight-set teeth, they worked a
little harder, to keep pace with the freshness and vigour of the
newcomers. Ninety shovels were hurling the coal aside, digging into it,
eating it away. Here, there, and everywhere the officials went, seeing
that every stroke told, that not an ounce of energy was wasted, taking a
hand themselves, driving themselves as hard as any of the men. Soon the
coal was heaped so high along the sides of the cut that a force was put
to work throwing it farther back. Almost all of it had to be handled
twice!</p>

<p>Noon came—a dark noon without a sun; a noon marked by no hour of rest
for these toilers. Back in the wrecking-car a great boiler of coffee
steamed and bubbled; the cook carried pails of it among the men, who
paused only long enough to swallow a big dipperful. Even Allan, who had
no taste for it, drank deep and long, and he was astonished at the flood
of warm vigour it seemed to send through him. Every half-hour this
coffee was passed around, strong and black and stimulating. It was a
stimulation for which the men would pay later on in limp reaction, but
it did its work now.</p>

<p>Experience had proved that no other means was so good as this to sustain
men against fatigue, hour after hour, and to drive away sleep from the
brain. Time was when the railroad company had experimented with other
stimulants, but they had long since been discarded.</p>

<p>Still the rain descended, and a biting wind from the north turned the
weather steadily colder and colder. A sheet of sleet formed over the
coal, welding it into a solid mass, which required the vigorous use of
picks to dislodge. The men slipped and stumbled, gasping with
exhaustion, but still the shovels rose and fell. Here and there, the
twisted and broken track began to appear.</p>

<p>At the side of the track the train-master called a lineman, who carried
a wire up a pole and attached it to one of the wires overhead. A
telegraph instrument was connected with this, and, sitting down upon the
bank, the train-master ticked in to headquarters the news that the track
would be clear at midnight, and repaired six hours later.</p>

<p>In this, as in everything, the train-master knew his men. Ten minutes
before midnight the last shovelful of coal was out of the way,—the track
was clear,—one part of the battle had been won. But another part yet
remained to fight,—the track must be rebuilt, and the work of doing it
began without a moment’s delay. The twisted rails and splintered ties
were wrenched out of the way; the road-bed, which had been ploughed up
by the wheels of the derailed cars, was hastily levelled. From the
wrecking-car gangs of men staggered under new ties and rails, which were
piled along beside the track where they would be needed.</p>

<p>At last the road-bed was fairly level again, and ties were laid with
feverish energy by the light of the flaring torches, which gave the
scene a weirdness which it had lacked by day. Phantoms of men moved back
and forth, now disappearing in the darkness, now leaping into view
again, working doggedly on, to their very last ounce of strength and
endurance.</p>

<p>As the ties were got into place, the rails were spiked down upon them
and fish-plates were bolted into place. Rod after rod they advanced,
tugging, hammering, with the energy of desperation. It was no question
now of a perfect road-bed—rail must be joined to rail so that once more
the red blood of commerce could be pumped along the artery they formed.
After that there would be time for the fine points. And just as the sun
peeped over the eastern hills, the last spike was driven, the last bolt
tightened. The work was done.</p>

<p>The men cheered wildly, savagely, their voices hoarse and unnatural.
Then they gathered up their tools, staggered to the car, and fell
exhausted on bunk or chair or floor, and went instantly to sleep. Allan
found afterward that he had no memory whatever of those last trying
hours.</p>

<p>At the side of the road the train-master was ticking off a message which
told that his promise was kept,—a message which sent a thrill of life
along the line from end to end,—which told that the road was clear. Then
he cut loose his instrument, and he and the superintendent walked back
to the car together. They were no longer the trim, good-looking men of
every day—they were haggard, gaunt, unshaven. Their eyes were bloodshot,
their clothing soiled and torn. They had not spared themselves. For
thirty-six hours they had been working without so much as lifting their
hats from their heads. But they had won the battle—as they had won many
others like it, though few quite so desperate.</p>

<p>On either side the track was piled a mass of twisted wreckage; the
engine still lay high on the bank. That could wait. Another crew could
haul the engine down and gather up the débris, for the track was open.</p>

<p>The journey back took longer than the journey out. At every siding they
headed in to let passenger and freight whirl past; the blood was
bounding now, trying to make up for the time it had been stopped. But
the men lying in the car saw none of them; the roar of their passage did
not awaken them—they knew not whether the trip back took two hours or
ten—they were deaf, blind, dead with fatigue. Only at the journey’s end
were they awakened, and it was no easy task. But at last they had all
arisen, gaunt shadows of their former selves.</p>

<p>“Boys,” said the superintendent, “I want to tell you that I’ve never
seen a wreck handled as well as you handled this one. You did great
work, and I’m proud of you. Now go home and go to sleep,—sleep
twenty-four hours if you can. Don’t report for duty till to-morrow. And
I promise you I won’t forget this night’s work.”</p>

<p>They staggered away through the curious crowd at the station, seeing
nothing, turning instinctively in the direction of their homes.</p>

<p>“Why,” remarked one white-haired man, gazing after them, “they look just
as we looked after we got through the Wilderness. They look like they’ve
been under fire for a week.”</p>

<p>The superintendent, passing, heard the remark.</p>

<p>“They have,” he answered, dryly. “They’ve been under the heaviest kind
of fire continuously for thirty-six hours. You fellows have had whole
libraries written about you, and about a thousand monuments built to
you. You get a pension while you live, and your grave is decorated when
you die. I’m not saying you don’t deserve it all, for I believe you do.
But there’s some other people in the world who deserve honour and glory,
too,—section-men, for instance. I never heard of anybody building a
monument to them, or calling them heroes; and, if there are any flowers
on their graves, it’s their families put them there!”</p>

<p>He passed on, while his auditor stared open-mouthed, not knowing whether
to be moved or angry. The superintendent’s nerves were shaken somewhat,
or he might have spoken less bitterly; but a sudden sharp sense of the
world’s injustice had clamoured for utterance.</p>

<p>And the wrecking-train was run in again on the siding, ready for the
next trip.</p>

<p>The men, of course, paid the penalty for their almost superhuman
exertions. No men could work as they had done and not feel the
after-effects in diminished vitality. The younger ones among them soon
recovered, for youth has a wonderful power of recuperation; the older
ones were a little more bent, a little more gnarled and withered, a
little nearer the end of the journey. They had sacrificed themselves on
the altar of the great system which they served; they had done so
without a murmur, with no thought of shirking or holding back. They
would do so again without an instant’s hesitation whenever duty called
them. For that was their life-work, to which they were dedicated with a
simple, unquestioning devotion. There was something touching about
it,—something grand and noble, too,—just as there is in a man dedicating
himself to any work, whether to conquer the world with Napoleon, or to
keep clean a stretch of street pavement committed to his care. It was
this dedication, this singleness of purpose—this serfdom to the
road—which Allan grew to understand more and more deeply, and to glory
in.</p>

<p>And it was not an unworthy service, for the road was worth devotion. Not
the company of capitalists, who sat in an office somewhere in the East
and manipulated its stocks and bonds, but the road itself,—this thing of
steel and oak which had rendered possible the development of the
country, which had added fabulously to its wealth, which bound together
its widely separated States into one indivisible Union. They were
servants of the force which, more than any other, has made our modern
civilization possible.</p>

<p>Let me add that the story of this wreck is no imaginary one. It is a
true story which actually occurred just as it is set down here; it is an
experience which repeats itself over and over again in the life of every
railroad man; it was a battle which, in one form or another, railroad
men are always fighting, and always winning. And, more than most
battles, is it worth winning!</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XIII.</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>A NEW DANGER</span>
</h2>

<p>There is a superstition among railroad men which, strangely enough, is
seemingly warranted by experience, that when one wreck occurs, two more
are certain to follow. And, sure enough, two more did follow, though
neither was so serious as the one at Vinton; which, indeed, still lives
in the memories of those who helped clear it away as the worst that ever
happened on the division.</p>

<p>Not so serious, that is, in delaying the traffic of the road, but more
serious in another way, since both entailed loss of life. The first one
occurred just three days after the wreck at Vinton. A freight-train had
taken a siding about five miles east of Wadsworth to allow the through
east-bound express to pass, but the brakeman on the freight, who was a
green hand, forgot to throw the switch back again after the
freight-train had backed in upon the siding. He climbed up into the cab,
and he and the engineer and fireman sat there chatting away, all
unconscious of the impending disaster. In a moment, they heard the roar
of the approaching train, and then it flashed into view far down the
track. They turned to watch it, to admire the clean lines of the engine
as it whirled toward them; then, as it reached the switch, they were
horrified to see it turn in upon the siding. There was no time to move,
to cry out, to attempt to save themselves. An instant of horrified
suspense, and the crash came, and the two engines, together with the
cars immediately behind them, were piled together into a torn and
twisted mass of wreckage,—wreckage through which blistering steam hissed
and about which in a moment hungry flames began to lap,—wreckage from
which no man came forth alive. But, as the accident occurred upon a
siding, the main track was not even blocked, and the wreckage was
cleared away without the feverish haste which marked the wreck at
Vinton.</p>

<p>The third wreck occurred at Torch, a little station on the east end of
the road, when both engineer and fireman of an east-bound freight-train
forgot their orders to take the siding there, to make way for the
west-bound flier, and continued on full speed past the station. The
conductor recognized the error at once, but he was away back in the
caboose at the other end of the train. He sent a brakeman flying forward
over the cars to warn the engineer of his danger, but, before he had got
forward half the length of the train, the express hurtled down upon
them, and both engineer and fireman paid for their forgetfulness with
their lives. This wreck was so far east that it was handled from
Parkersburg, and the gang from Section Twenty-one was not called out.</p>

<p>This series of accidents impressed deeply upon Allan’s mind the terrible
peculiarity which belongs to railroading. In most of life’s ordinary
occupations, a mistake may be retrieved; on the railroad, almost never.
To make a mistake there is, almost inevitably, to sacrifice life and
property. The railroad man who makes a mistake never has the chance to
make a second one. If he survives the first one, his dismissal from the
road’s employ will follow. Mistakes on a railroad are too expensive to
risk them by employing careless men.</p>

<p>The employés of the road breathed easier after the accident at Torch.
Until the fatal three had occurred, every man feared that his turn would
come next; now they knew that they were safe until another series was
started. Whether it was from the increased self-confidence and
self-control which this belief engendered, or whether there really was
some basis for this railroad superstition, at any rate, no more
accidents occurred, and the road’s operation proceeded smoothly and
uneventfully.</p>

<p>One exciting battle there was in late September. The fall rains had been
unusually heavy and persistent; every little brook became a roaring
torrent, loosening bridges and culverts, seeping under the road-bed, and
demanding constant vigilance on the part of the section-gangs. As the
rain continued without abating, the broad river, which usually flowed
peacefully along far below the railroad embankment, rose foot by foot
until the whole stretch of embankment along the river’s edge was
threatened. Long trains of flat cars were hurried to the place, loaded
with rock and bags of sand. These were dumped along the embankment,
which was washing badly in places, and for a time it looked as though
the encroachments of the water had been stopped. But the rain continued,
and the river kept on rising, until it was seeping along the top of the
embankment. If it once began to flow over it, nothing could save the
track, for the water would slice away the earth beneath it in great
sections.</p>

<p>All the men that could be spared from the other portions of the road had
been hurried to the scene. At the gravel-pit just below the city, a gang
of fifty men was working, filling heavy sacks and loading them on flat
cars. A great steam-shovel was heaping the loose gravel upon other cars,
and, as soon as enough were loaded to make a train, they were hurried
away to the danger point. During that culminating day, no effort was
made to preserve the train schedule. The work-trains were given the
right of way, and even the lordly east-bound passengers had to flag
through from the embankment to the gravel-pit. Train-master and
superintendent were on the spot, directing where the gravel should be
dumped, and watching anxiously the gauge which marked the rise of the
water. Another inch and it would be over the embankment.</p>

<p>But from the last inspection of the gauge Mr. Schofield arose with a
shout of triumph.</p>

<p>“It’s no higher than it was half an hour ago,” he said. “It hasn’t risen
a hair’s breadth. It’ll begin to fall before long. We’re all right if we
can only make the embankment hold.”</p>

<p>Hope put new life into the men, and they worked like beavers; but
whether the embankment could withstand much longer the tremendous
pressure of the water against it seemed exceedingly doubtful. The whole
length of the river seemed to be concentrating its strength to push
against this one spot. Allan, as he paused to look up the muddy current,
almost imagined that the water was rushing toward the embankment with
the deliberate purpose of overwhelming it. The débris which the broad
current hurried along told of the damage it was doing in other places.
Lordly trees had been uprooted, outbuildings carried away, stock
drowned, fertile bottom land covered with gravel and rendered
worthless,—but all this seemed trivial to the boy beside the danger
which threatened the road. He could guess how long it would take to
rebuild this great stretch of embankment, should it be swept away. For
weeks and months, the system must lay powerless, lifeless, disrupted.</p>

<p>Mr. Schofield bent over the gauge again and looked at it.</p>

<p>“She’s going down, boys!” he cried, rising with beaming face. “She’s
gone down half an inch. We’re going to win this fight!”</p>

<p>But how slowly the water receded! It seemed to Allan, at times, that it
was rising again; but the crest of the flood had passed, and by the next
day the danger was quite over. The embankment had to be rebuilt where it
had been badly washed; and it was rebuilt more strongly than ever, and
guarded by a wall of riprap, but never for an hour was the traffic of
the road interrupted.</p>

<p>So October passed and November came. Always there was the track
demanding attention,—an endless round of work which would never be
completed. Always there were the trains rushing over it in endless
procession,—the luxurious Limited, sending every other train headlong
into a siding out of the way; the slower “accommodation,” which stops at
every station along the road and is very popular with the farmers and
dwellers at crossroads; the big through freight, drawn by a mighty giant
of an engine, hauling two thousand tons of grain or beef or coal to the
great Eastern market.</p>

<p>And the through freight is the greatest of them all, for it is the
money-maker. The Limited, glittering with polished brass and rare woods
and plate-glass, is for show,—for style. It makes the road a reputation.
It figures always in the advertisements in big type and on the back of
folder and time-table in gorgeous lithograph. Its passengers look out
with aversion at the dingy, ugly freight, standing on the siding,
waiting for it to pass. But it is the freight that is meat and drink to
the road; it enables it to keep out of the receiver’s hands, and
sometimes even to pay dividends.</p>

<p>For Allan, the days passed happily, for one serious cloud was lifted
from his life. Dan Nolan had disappeared. He had not been seen for
weeks, and every one hoped that he would never be seen in that
neighbourhood again. Jack had taken good care to spread the story of the
fallen rock, and Nolan was wise to keep out of the trainmen’s way.</p>

<p>“He thinks I saw him that day,” remarked the foreman, “an’ he’s afeard
of a term in th’ penitentiary. Well, he’ll git it; if not here,
somewheres else.”</p>

<p>One trouble still remained, for Reddy showed no sign of improvement. His
aversion to all his old friends seemed rather to increase, and he would
wander away for days at a time. With this development of vagrant habits,
he fell naturally in with other vagrants; played cards with them under
the big coal-chute, rode with them in empty box-cars,—in a word,
degenerated utterly from the happy, industrious Reddy of other days.
Still, he showed no disposition to harm any one, so his friends deemed
it best to let him go his way, hoping against hope that time might work
a cure. His wife had been given the position of janitress of the depot
building, and so provided for the family.</p>

<p>Physically, Allan had never been in such splendid condition. Constant
work in the open air had hardened his muscles and tanned his face; he
was lean and hard, his eyes clear, his nerves steady. He was always
ready for his bed at night, and always ready for his work in the
morning. He felt within himself an abounding health and vitality, that
brought him near to nature, and made him love her great winds and
tempests. The only things he missed were the books to which he had
always been accustomed. He was usually too tired in the evening to do
more than read the newspaper; but he was gaining for himself a
first-hand experience of life more valuable than any reflection of it he
could have caught from the printed page. The foundations of his
education had been well laid; now he was laying the foundations of
experience. Somehow, for the time being, books seemed to him strangely
useless and artificial. He was drinking deep of life itself.</p>

<p>And as the days passed, Allan grew to know the trainmen better. He was
admitted to the freemasonry of their fellowship, and sat with them often
in the evenings at roundhouse or yardmaster’s office, listening to their
yarns, which had a strange fascination for him. It was at the roundhouse
that engineers and firemen met, summoned by the caller to take their
engines out; at the yardmaster’s office, conductors and brakemen
reported. And the boy found all of them alike prepared for what might
befall, ready, instinctively, without second thought, to risk their
lives to save the company’s property or to protect the passengers
entrusted to their care.</p>

<p>A great admiration for these men grew into his heart. They were like
soldiers, ready at a moment’s notice to advance under fire,—only here
there was not the wild exhilaration of battle, of charge and sortie, but
only a long, cold looking of danger in the face.</p>

<p>Even the humblest of them had his heroisms, as the boy found out one
night; for, surely, none was humbler than Bill Griffith, the lame
crossing-flag-man. It was at the roundhouse one evening that Allan
chanced to ask how Bill lost his leg. “Tookey” Morton—the oldest
engineer on the road—who had just come in to report, turned around at
the question.</p>

<p>“He’s lost both legs, my boy,” he said. “He’s wood on both sides from
the knee down, only you can’t see it because his pant-legs hide it. Ten
years ago, Bill was one of the best engineers on this road. He had the
old Ninety-six,—you remember her, boys,—one of them old
passenger-engines, built too light for the business. Well, one night
Bill was spinnin’ down the grade at Loveland when the side-rod on his
side broke, and in about half a second had whipped the cab to pieces and
smashed both Bill’s legs. His fireman, who was green, jumped at the
first crash; so what did Bill do but get up on the stumps of his legs
and walk to the throttle and shut her off. They found him layin’ on what
was left of the deck, and thought he was dead. But he pulled through,
and was given that billet at the crossin’. And there ain’t a man, woman,
or child has been hurt there since he’s had it.”</p>

<p>The section-men were soon to have their hours of danger, too, for the
road was falling among troublesome times. The first wind of it came in
an order to all employés issued from general headquarters.</p>

<p>Jack stuck a copy of it on the order-hook on the wall of the
section-shanty, and then read it over again with a very dark face. Thus
it ran:</p>

<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>

<p>“NOTICE TO EMPLOYÉS, ALL DEPARTMENTS</p>

<p>“The police department of this road has just been reorganized, and all
employés are hereby directed to aid it in every possible way in keeping
all trains, freight and passenger, free from tramps. This nuisance has
grown to such proportions that it must be checked. Trainmen discovered
permitting tramps to ride on their trains will be summarily discharged.
Section-men will see that no fires are built by tramps on the right of
way, and that they do not linger on railroad property.</p>

<div style='text-align:right'>“[Signed] A. G. Round,</div>
<div style='text-align:right; font-style:italic'>“Supt. and Gen. Manager.</div>

<p style='text-indent:0'><i>“Cincinnati, Ohio, November 14.”</i></p>

</div>

<p>“That means trouble,” said Jack, “if they try t’ carry it out,” and
turned away to his work without further comment.</p>

<p>But that night in the yardmaster’s office Allan heard the order
discussed with freedom and much emphasis.</p>

<p>“We can’t deny,” said one man, “that th’ hoboes have been robbin’ th’
road right an’ left, but what kin we do? Try t’ put ’em off an’ git a
bullet through us or a knife in us?”</p>

<p>“It’s put ’em off or git fired,” remarked another, grimly.</p>

<p>“The road couldn’t stand it any longer,” remarked the yardmaster. “Car
after car has come into the yards here broken open and any amount of
stuff missing. It’s been costing the road a pretty figure to straighten
things out with the shippers.”</p>

<p>“The tramps get in out here at the heavy grade just east of Byers,”
remarked a conductor. “Those fool despatchers load us up so heavy that
we can’t make more than six or eight miles an hour up that
grade,—sometimes we stick and have to double over. Well, the tramps lay
for us there every night, and, while we’re crawling along, or maybe
cutting the train in two to double, they pick out a likely looking car
of merchandise, break it open, hunt around inside, and throw off what
they want, and then drop off themselves. We don’t even know the seals
are broken until we get into the yards here.”</p>

<p>“There’s a dozen other places on the road just as bad,” said the
yardmaster.</p>

<p>“But how’s a feller t’ know what’s goin’ on inside a car?” queried a
brakeman, sarcastically. “That’s what I’d like to be told.”</p>

<p>“Well,” retorted the yardmaster, “I guess the superintendent will tell
you quick enough, if he ever gets you on the carpet.”</p>

<p>The brakeman snorted skeptically.</p>

<p>“I dunno,” he said. “I guess th’ whole thing’s jest a bluff, anyway.”</p>

<p>But trainmen and tramps alike soon found out that the management of the
road was in deadly earnest. The force of police had been strongly
reinforced. Tramps were summarily thrown off the trains. When they
showed fight, as they often did at first, they were promptly arrested,
arraigned before the nearest police justice, and given a term in the
workhouse.</p>

<p>To be sure, all this was not accomplished without some cost. One
detective was shot through the head and killed, and many others had
escapes more or less narrow, but the tramps soon lost their boldness.
They no longer broke open freight-cars at will and helped themselves to
their contents, or rode from place to place as their fancy dictated. But
they took their revenge in other ways.</p>

<p>One night an extra west-bound freight ran through an open switch at
Greenfield and crashed into the freight-house. An investigation showed
that the switch-lock had been broken, and the switch thrown. A night
watchman on Section Twenty-eight found a big pile of ties on the track,
and stopped another freight just in time to prevent a wreck.</p>

<p>Ugly rumours were flying about of the tramps’ intentions, and it was at
this juncture that another order came from headquarters. It ran:</p>

<div style='margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; margin-right:2em; margin-left:2em'>
<div style='text-align:center; text-indent:0; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; '>
<div style='margin-bottom:0.7em;'>“NOTICE TO SECTION-FOREMEN</div>
</div>

<p>“All section-foremen, until further orders, will divide their gangs into
tricks, and have one man constantly on duty patrolling the track from
end to end of their section. All sections must be gone over not less
than once every three hours, and special vigilance is required at night.
The road relies upon its section-men to see that this work is faithfully
done. Double time will be allowed for this extra duty. To go into effect
at once.</p>

<div style='text-align:right'>“[Signed] A. G. Round,</div>
<div style='text-align:right; font-style:italic'>“Supt. and Gen. Manager.</div>

<p style='text-indent:0'><i>“Cincinnati, Ohio, November 30.”</i></p>

</div>

<p>And simultaneously the road’s police force was augmented by a dozen
special detectives. The management was determined to prove that it could
protect its property. Besides, the other roads of the country were
looking on with much interest to see what the result of this struggle
would be, for the tramp nuisance was rampant everywhere.</p>

<p>For a time, it seemed that these precautions had been effective. There
were no more robberies reported, and few tramps attempted to steal
rides. To be sure, the station at Madeira caught fire one night and
burned to the ground, but there was no proof of incendiarism. Still the
road did not relax its vigilance. Threatening rumours came to it from
the underworld. The detectives, assuming tramp garb and fraternizing
with the “hoboes,” became aware of something sinister in the air, but
could never quite fathom the mystery. They were sure of only one
thing—something was going to happen.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

<h2 class='nobreak' id='chXIV' title='XIV: ALLAN MAKES A DISCOVERY'>
  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XIV.</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>ALLAN MAKES A DISCOVERY</span>
</h2>

<p>During all this time, Allan had been taking his trick of track-walking
with the other men on Section Twenty-one. Jack had arranged it so that
the boy’s trip over the road was made in the early morning, from four
o’clock to seven, when, in his opinion, there was the minimum of danger.
For Jack still feared Dan Nolan, although that rascal had not been seen
in the neighbourhood for months. But Jack had an uneasy feeling that
Nolan was still plotting mischief, that he was still watching his
opportunity to do Allan an injury.</p>

<p>The boy himself, confident in his growing manhood, laughed at these
fears.</p>

<p>“Nolan has cleared out for good,” he said to Jack. “He’s gone somewhere
where he’s not known, and has got another job. We’ll never see him
again.”</p>

<p>But Jack shook his head stubbornly.</p>

<p>“I know better,” he said. “Mebbe he’s gone away for awhile, but he’ll
come back ag’in, an’, if he ever gits a good chance t’ hit y’ from
behind, he’ll take it. I’ve got a sort of idee that Nolan’s at th’
bottom of most of th’ devilment that’s been goin’ on on this here road.
Th’ tramps would ’a’ cleared out long ago if there hadn’t been somebody
back of them urgin’ ’em on.”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, Jack,” protested Allan, “you’ve let that idea get such a hold
on you that you can’t shake it off.”</p>

<p>“Anyway,” said Jack, “I want you t’ keep your eyes about you when you’re
out there by yourself. An’ you’re t’ carry that club I made fer you, an’
t’ use it, too, if Nolan ever comes near enough for you t’ git a good
lick at him.”</p>

<p>Allan laughed again, but he carried the club with him, nevertheless,
more to quiet Jack’s fears and Mary’s than because he thought he would
ever need it. Jack had gone down to the carpenter shop the first day the
order to patrol the track was posted, and had selected a piece of
seasoned hickory, which he had fashioned into an effective weapon. Most
of the other section-men were similarly armed, and were prepared to meet
force with force.</p>

<p>But Jack’s fears were to be verified in an unexpected way a few days
later. One of the detectives employed by the road had succeeded in
disguising himself as a tramp so effectively that he was admitted to
their councils, and one night a force of men was gathered at
headquarters for an expedition of which none of them knew the
destination. It happened to be Jack’s trick, and, when he reported for
duty, the train-master called him to one side.</p>

<p>“Welsh,” he said, “we’re going on a little expedition to-night which
promises some fun. I thought maybe you’d like that boy of yours to go
along,—you seem to want to get him in on everything going.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Mister Schofield?” Jack asked. “Anything dangerous?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered the train-master, “I don’t think there’ll be any real
danger, but there may be some excitement. I want you to go and you’d
better bring the boy.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir,” said Jack, resolving, however, to keep the boy close
to himself.</p>

<p>A caller was sent after Allan, who appeared at the end of a few minutes,
his eyes big with excitement.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he asked, as he saw the men grouped together, talking in
low tones. “Another wreck?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Jack; “it ain’t a wreck. I don’t know what it is. It’s got
something t’ do with th’ tramps, I think. Mebbe you’d better not go.”</p>

<p>“Of course I’ll go,” protested the boy. “I wouldn’t miss it for
anything.”</p>

<p>A moment later the men, of whom there were twenty, were divided into
parties of four each, and each man was given a short, stout policeman’s
club loaded with lead at the end.</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” said the train-master, after the clubs had been
distributed, “I want you to remember that it’s an easy thing to kill a
man with one of those clubs, so don’t strike too hard if we get into a
row. Only, of course, don’t hesitate to defend yourselves. Now I guess
we’re ready to start.”</p>

<p>Each party was placed in charge of one of the road’s detectives, and
left the yards by a different route. The night was very dark, with black
clouds rolling overhead and sending down a spatter of rain now and then,
so that the men could scarcely see each other as they walked along. The
party that Jack and Allan were with followed the railroad track as far
as the river-bank; then they turned aside, crossed the long bridge which
spanned the river, and pushed their way along a path which led to the
right along the opposite bank.</p>

<p>It was anything but easy walking, for the path was a narrow and uneven
one, nearly overgrown by the rank underbrush along the river, so that
they had to proceed in single file, the detective in the lead, stumbling
over rocks, stepping into mudholes, with branches slapping them in the
faces, and briars catching at their clothing. At last they came out upon
an open field, which they crossed. Beyond the field was a road, which
they followed for half a mile or more, then they struck off along
another path through an open hickory wood, and finally halted for breath
at the base of a high hill.</p>

<p>In a few moments, the other parties came up, panting and
mud-bespattered, and the detectives and Mr. Schofield drew apart for a
little consultation.</p>

<p>“Now, boys,” said Mr. Schofield, in a low voice, when the consultation
was over, “I’ll tell you what we’re after so that you’ll know what to
expect. One of our men here has discovered up on this hill the place
where the ringleaders among the tramps make their headquarters. If we
can capture these ringleaders, all our troubles with the tramps will be
over. We’re going to surround the place, and we want to capture every
one of them. We must creep up on them as quietly as we can, and then a
pistol-shot will be the signal for a rush. And, remember, we don’t want
any of them to get away!”</p>

<p>A little murmur ran through the crowd, and they gripped their clubs
tighter. Jack was glad that they had not been given revolvers,—in the
darkness and confusion, such weapons would be more dangerous to friend
than foe.</p>

<p>They started cautiously up the hill, advancing slowly and painfully, for
there was now no vestige of a path. The uneven ground and tangled
undergrowth made progress very difficult, but they gradually worked
their way upward until they came to the edge of a little clearing.
Against a cliff of rock at one side a rude hut was built. There was no
window, but, through the chinks in the logs, they could see that there
was a light within. The men were spread out along the edge of the
clearing, and waited breathlessly for the signal to advance.</p>

<p>The pistol-shot rang out, clear and sharp in the night air, and, even as
the men sprang forward, the door of the hut was thrown open and a man’s
figure appeared silhouetted against the light. He stood an instant
listening to the rush of advancing footsteps, then slammed the door
shut, and in a breath the hut was in darkness.</p>

<p>But that single instant was enough for both Allan and Jack Welsh to
recognize the man.</p>

<p>It was Dan Nolan!</p>

<p>In another second, they were hammering at the door, but they found it
strongly barred, and three or four minutes elapsed—minutes that seemed
like centuries—before they got the door down and rushed over the
threshold into the hut. One of the detectives opened his dark lantern
and flashed a brilliant band of light about the place, while the men
stared in astonishment.</p>

<p>For the hut was empty!</p>

<p>They lighted the lamp which stood on a box in one corner and made a more
careful examination of the place. Two or three boxes, an old stove, a
few cooking utensils, and a rude cot in one corner comprised all the
furniture, and one of the detectives, pulling aside the largest box,
which stood against the back of the hut, solved the mystery of Nolan’s
disappearance.</p>

<p>A passage had been dug in the bank which formed the back of the hut, and
the detective, after flashing his dark lantern within, crawled into it
without hesitation. In a few moments, they heard the sound of steps
outside, and the detective came in again at the door.</p>

<p>“He’s got clear away,” he said; “as well as all the rest who were with
him. That tunnel leads off to the left and comes out the other side of
this bank.”</p>

<p>Mr. Schofield’s face showed his disappointment.</p>

<p>“It’s too bad,” he said, “that we didn’t know about that tunnel. Then we
could have placed a guard at the other end.”</p>

<p>“There were precious few knew about it,” said the detective who had
discovered the place. “I’ve been here half a dozen times, and never
suspected its existence.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said the train-master, “the only thing we can do is to go home,
I guess. We can’t hope to find a man in these woods on a night like
this.”</p>

<p>“You knowed that feller who opened th’ door, didn’t you, Mister
Schofield?” questioned Jack, as they left the hut.</p>

<p>“No,” said Mr. Schofield, quickly. “Did you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Jack, quietly; “it was Dan Nolan.”</p>

<p>“Dan Nolan!” repeated the train-master, incredulously. “Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Allan here knowed him, too,” said Jack. “It’s what I’ve been thinkin’
all along, that Nolan was at th’ bottom of all this mischief. He’s got
t’ be a kind o’ king o’ th’ tramps, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you’re right,” agreed Mr. Schofield. “I’ll put our detectives
on his trail. Maybe they can run him down, if he hasn’t been scared away
by his narrow escape to-night.”</p>

<p>“He’ll shift his headquarters,” said Jack, “but I don’t believe he’ll be
scared away—not till he gits what he’s after, anyway.”</p>

<p>“And what is that?” questioned the train-master.</p>

<p>“He’s after Allan there,” said Jack, in a lower tone. “An’ he’ll git him
yet, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll make it hot for him around here,” said Mr. Schofield, and
went forward to impart this information to the detectives.</p>

<p>All of the men were completely tired out by the long night tramp, as
well as chagrined over their ill success, but Allan was up again as
usual next morning and started off upon his tramp along the track.</p>

<p>“Now, be careful of yourself, darlint,” Mary cautioned him, as she saw
him off, and Allan promised to be especially alert.</p>

<p>There could be no doubt that it was Dan Nolan they had seen at the door
of the hut the night before, but Allan only half-believed that Nolan
still preserved his enmity toward him. Certainly, he decided, it was not
worth worrying about,—worrying never did any good. He would be ready to
meet danger as it came, but he greatly doubted if it would ever come, at
least, to himself personally.</p>

<p>He had grown to like this duty of patrolling the track. It had been a
pleasant duty, and an uneventful one, for at no time had he found
anything wrong, or met with unpleasant adventure of any kind. But those
long walks through the fresh, cold air, with the dawn just tingeing the
east, opened a new world to the boy. It was no longer the hot, dusty,
work-a-day world of labour, but a sweet, cool, clean world, where joy
dwelt and where a man might grow. He heard the birds greet the sunrise
with never-failing joy; he heard the cattle lowing in the fields; even
the river beside the road seemed to dance with new life, as the sun’s
rays sought it out and gilded its every ripple. It was not a long
walk—three miles out and three back—and what an appetite for breakfast
it gave him! Even these few months had wrought a great change in him. He
was browned by the sun and hardened by toil, as has been said already;
but the change was greater than that. It was mental as well as physical.
He had grown older, and his face had gained the self-reliant look of the
man who is making his own way in the world and who is sure of himself.</p>

<p>Despite all this extra work, Section Twenty-one was kept in perfect
condition, and the train-master noted it, as he noted everything else
about the road.</p>

<p>“You’re doing good work, Welsh,” he said to Jack one day, when he
chanced to meet him in the yards.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a good gang,” answered the foreman, proudly. “There’s one o’
my men that’s too good fer section work. He ort t’ have a better job,
Mr. Schofield; one, anyway, where ther’s a chance fer permotion—in th’
offices.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” and the official smiled good-naturedly. “I think I know who you
mean. I’ll keep him in mind, for we always need good men. This extra
work will soon be over, though. As soon as cold weather sets in, the
hoboes will strike for the South, and I don’t believe they’ll ever
trouble us again.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe not,” agreed Jack, dubiously. “But I’d be mighty glad to hear
that Dan Nolan was locked up safe somewhere. You haven’t found any trace
of him?”</p>

<p>“No. He seems to have disappeared completely. I believe he’s scared out,
and cold weather will rid us of all the rest.”</p>

<p>“Mebbe so,” said Jack; “mebbe so. Anyway, I wish cold weather’d hurry up
an’ come.”</p>

<p>But it seemed in no haste about coming. December opened bright and warm,
and two weeks slipped by. Although it was evident that the tramps were
becoming less numerous, and the management of the road began to breathe
more freely, still the head of the police department did not relax his
caution. He had his ear to the ground, and, from that hidden,
subterranean region of trampdom, he still heard vague and uncertain, but
no less threatening, rumblings.</p>

<p>It was clear that the battle was not yet won, for the petty annoyances
continued, though in an ever lessening degree, and even in the yards the
tramps or their sympathizers managed to do much harm. A freight-train
would be standing in the yards, ready for its trip east or west; the
conductor would give the signal to start, the engineer would open his
throttle, and instantly it would be discovered that some one had drawn
all the coupling-pins; but, before the engineer could stop his engine,
he had torn out all the air-hose on the train. Or, perhaps, the train
would start all right, but, in the course of half an hour, the fireman
would discover he could not keep the steam up, no matter how hot his
fire was; the pressure would fall and fall until the train would be
stalled out on the road, and an investigation would disclose the fact
that some one had thrown a lot of soap into the tank. Then the whole
system would be tied up until another engine could be sent to the rescue
to push the train into the nearest siding. Or, perhaps, the train would
be bowling along merrily until, of a sudden, the well-trained noses of
conductor and brakemen would detect the odour of a hot box. The train
would be stopped, and it would soon be found that some one had removed
the packing from the boxes.</p>

<p>All of these things were provoking enough, especially since it was
evident that in almost every case the mischief had been done in the
yards under the very noses of the trainmen, although no tramps had been
seen there. Indeed, the trainmen, after wrestling with such annoyances
for a time, came to be of a temper that made it exceedingly dangerous
for a tramp to be found anywhere near railroad property. Yet the
annoyances went on, and became gradually of a more serious nature. One
night a brakeman found the main switch at the east end of the yards
spiked, and it was only by a hair’s breadth that a serious collision was
avoided. But the climax came one morning when Bill Morrison, on the
crack engine of the road, found that some one had put sand in his boxes,
and that the journals were ground off and ruined.</p>

<p>A rigid investigation was ordered at once, but no clue to the
perpetrator of the mischief was discovered. Yet it seemed certain that
it could not have been done by a tramp. No tramp had been in the
yards—the yard-men were sure of that—and the officials were forced to
the unwelcome conclusion that some one whom they did not suspect—some
one who was permitted to enter the yards—some one connected with the
road, perhaps—was guilty. It was a disquieting thought, for there was no
telling what might happen next.</p>

<p>And then, one morning, Allan solved the mystery. It was a little after
four o’clock and still quite dark as he passed through the yards to
start on his morning walk. A freight-train stood ready to start east,
with its great mogul of an engine puffing and blowing with impatience.
Just as Allan passed it, he saw a figure emerge from underneath it. He
thought at first it was the engineer, but, instead of mounting to the
cab, the figure slunk away into the darkness, carefully avoiding the
glare of the headlight. Then the boy saw the conductor and engineer
standing, with heads together, a little distance away, reading their
orders by the light of the conductor’s lantern. He ran toward them.</p>

<p>“Mr. Spurling,” he said to the engineer, “I just saw a man come out from
under your engine.”</p>

<p>“You did!” and engineer and conductor, with compressed lips, hurried
back to where the engine stood. The former flashed his torch underneath,
and then straightened up with a very grim face.</p>

<p>“Look at that link-motion,” he said, and the conductor stooped and
looked. Then he, too, straightened up.</p>

<p>“It’s a good thing we didn’t get started,” he said. “I’ll go and report
it. It’s lucky for us you saw that scoundrel, my boy,” he added, as he
hurried away, and the engineer clapped Allan on the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Mighty lucky,” he said. “It’s a good thing there’s one man around here
who keeps his eyes open.”</p>

<p>But Allan, as he started away at last upon his six-mile tramp, knew not
whether to be glad or sorry. If only some one else had passed the engine
at that moment instead of him. For, as that crouching figure slunk away
through the darkness, he had recognized it!</p>

<p>So he had a battle to fight on that six-mile tramp; but it was fought
and won long before the walk was ended. And when, at last, he got back
to the yards, instead of turning away toward home, he mounted the stairs
to the train-master’s office. That official was busy, as always, with a
great pile of correspondence, but he looked up and nodded pleasantly as
Allan entered.</p>

<p>“Good morning, West,” he said. “Want to speak to me?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Schofield,” answered Allan. “This morning, as I was starting
out on my trick, I saw a man come out from under Mr. Spurling’s engine.”</p>

<p>The train-master nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “I’ve got a report of it here. I’m mighty glad you
happened to come along just when you did, and had your eyes about you.”</p>

<p>“I’d much rather it had been somebody else,” said Allan, “for I knew the
man, and I think it’s my duty to tell you.”</p>

<p>The train-master looked at him keenly.</p>

<p>“You knew him?” he repeated. “Better and better. No doubt he’s the one
who’s been giving us all this trouble. Who was he?”</p>

<p>Allan gulped down a lump which had arisen suddenly in his throat.</p>

<p>“Reddy Magraw,” he answered, hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Reddy Magraw!” echoed the train-master, with a stare of astonishment.
“Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t say so if I wasn’t sure, sir,” answered Allan, with a little
flush of resentment. “I couldn’t be mistaken.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” agreed the train-master, kindly. “But I didn’t think Reddy
would do anything like that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe he would have done it, sir,” said Allan, “if Dan Nolan
hadn’t got hold of him,” and he told of the conference he and Jack had
witnessed on the river-bank. “I believe Dan put all this meanness into
his head,” he concluded. “I’m sure it’s with Dan he stays all the time
he’s away from home.”</p>

<p>Mr. Schofield nodded again.</p>

<p>“No doubt you are right,” he assented. “Perhaps we ought to have
suspected him before. Of course, the boys never thought of watching him,
and so let him stay around the yards as much as he wanted to. But we’ll
have to protect ourselves. This sort of thing can’t go on.”</p>

<p>“You mean Reddy will have to be arrested?” questioned Allan, with
sinking heart.</p>

<p>“No,” and the train-master smiled at his anxious face. “I’ll file an
affidavit of lunacy against Reddy before the probate judge, and we’ll
have him sent to the asylum at Athens. He’ll be well taken care of
there, and maybe will get well again much sooner than he would at home.
He’s not getting any better here, that’s certain; and he’s caused us a
lot of trouble. Besides, he’s only a burden to his wife.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she never thinks of that,” said Allan, quickly. “It’s his staying
away that hurts her.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Mr. Schofield, “I know. I’ve talked with her. She’s like
all the rest of these big-hearted Irish women,—ready to work herself to
death for the people she loves. Though,” he added, “that’s a
characteristic of nearly all women.”</p>

</h2>

<p>Mr. Schofield filed his affidavit before the probate judge without
delay, but, when the officer of the court went to look for Reddy, he was
nowhere to be found. From his wife it was learned that he had not been
home for two days, nor was he to be discovered in any of his accustomed
haunts around the yards or in the shops, and the quest for him was
finally given up in despair. Allan concluded that Reddy had recognized
him that morning, as he came out from under the engine which he had
tampered with, and knew that he was found out at last; but, whether this
was the case, or whether he had got wind of the proceedings against him
in some other way, certain it is that Reddy disappeared from Wadsworth,
and nothing more was seen of him there for many days.</p>

<p>Word was quietly passed around among the trainmen to be on the watch for
him, as he was probably the one who had recently caused the road so much
annoyance; and this came to be pretty well proved in time, for, with
Reddy’s disappearance, the annoyances ceased, in so far, at least, as
they originated in the yards at Wadsworth. Out on the line, indeed, they
still continued,—switches were spiked, fish-plates were loosened,—and
then, of a sudden, even these ceased, and everything ran as smoothly as
in the old days. But this very quiet alarmed the chief of detectives
more than anything else had done, for he believed it was the calm
preceding a storm, and he redoubled his precautions. Some of the
officers were rather inclined to laugh at his fears, but not the
superintendent.</p>

<p>“You are right, Preston,” he said to the chief. “There’s something in
the wind. We’ll look sharp till after the pay-car gets here, anyway.
After that, if nothing happens, we can let up a bit.”</p>

<p>“When will the pay-car get here?” questioned Preston.</p>

<p>“I don’t know yet; probably the night of the twenty-fourth.”</p>

<p>“You’d better order a double guard with it, sir,” suggested the
detective.</p>

<p>“I will,” assented the superintendent. “More than that, Mr. Schofield
and I will accompany it. If there’s any excitement, we want to be there
to see it.”</p>

<p>The detective nodded and went away, while the superintendent turned back
to his desk. It had occurred to him some days before that an attempt to
hold up the pay-car might be the culminating point of the series of
outrages under which the road was suffering, and the more he had thought
of it the more likely it appeared. The pay-car would be a rich prize,
and any gang of men who could get away with its contents would be placed
beyond the need of working, begging, or stealing for a long time to
come. The pay-car, which always started from general headquarters at
Cincinnati, went over the road, from one end to the other, every month,
carrying with it the money with which the employés of the road were
paid. To Wadsworth alone it brought monthly nearly two hundred thousand
dollars, for Wadsworth was division headquarters. Nearly all the
trainmen employed on the division lived there, and besides, there were
the hundreds of men who laboured in the division shops. Yes, the pay-car
would be a rich prize, and, as the money it carried was all in small
denominations, it would be impossible to trace it, once the robbers got
safely away with it.</p>

<p>Let it be said in passing that on most roads the pay-car is now a thing
of the past. Payment is now usually made by checks, which are sent out
in registered packages from general headquarters, and distributed by the
division officials. This method is safe and eminently satisfactory to
the road, but some of the employés object occasionally because of the
difficulty they sometimes experience in getting their checks cashed
immediately.</p>

<p>The road had never suffered any attack upon its pay-car, primarily, no
doubt, because it was well-known that there were always half a dozen
well-armed men with it, who would not hesitate to use their weapons. In
fact, every man, as he stood at the little grated cashier’s window,
waiting for his money, could see the row of rifles in the rack against
the wall and the brace of pistols lying upon the desk, ready to the
cashier’s hand. Besides, even if the car were broken into and the money
secured, the difficulty of getting away safely with the booty was
enormous. The road, for the most part, ran through a thickly settled
country, and the moment the alarm was given, posses could be set in
motion and the wires set humming in every direction, in the effort to
run the robbers down. So, with whatever hungry greed would-be highwaymen
had eyed the piles of bills and gold visible through the little grated
window, none of them had ever dared to make a forcible attempt to gain
possession of them.</p>

<p>Perhaps no one would dare attempt it now, thought the superintendent;
perhaps he had been merely alarming himself without cause. At least, the
most effective defensive measure would be to keep secret the hour of the
pay-car’s arrival. If no one knew exactly when to look for it, no
attempt could be made to hold it up. Such an attempt, at the best, would
be foolhardy, and the superintendent turned back to his work with a
little sigh of relief at the thought. In a few moments, immersed in the
pile of correspondence before him, he had quite forgotten his
uneasiness.</p>

<p>Certainly, as day after day went smoothly by, there seemed less and less
cause for apprehension. The tramps were evidently making southward, like
the birds, before the approach of winter. And nothing more was seen of
Dan Nolan. A watch had been kept upon the hut on the hillside, but he
had not returned there, so the hut was finally demolished and the tunnel
in the cliff closed up. Every effort had been made to discover his
whereabouts, but in vain. The detectives of the road declared that he
was nowhere in the neighbourhood; but Jack Welsh was, as always,
skeptical.</p>

<p>Just east of Wadsworth, beyond the river, the country rose into a series
of hills, sparsely settled and for the most part covered by virgin
forest. These hills extended for many miles to the eastward, and among
them, Jack told himself, Nolan could easily find a secure hiding-place
for himself and half a dozen men.</p>

<p>“An’ that’s jest where he is,” said Jack to Allan one evening, when they
were talking the matter over. “That’s jest what Nolan’d love t’ do—put
hisself at th’ head of a gang o’ bandits. He was allers talkin’ about
highwaymen an’ train-robbers an’ desperadoes when he was on th’ gang;
but we only laughed at him then. Now, I see it would have been a good
thing if I’d ’a’ taken a stout stick an’ beat that foolishness out o’
him.”</p>

<p>“But Reddy,” said Allan; “where’s Reddy?”</p>

<p>“Reddy’s with him,” answered Jack, decidedly. “An’ there’s no tellin’
what scrape that reptile’ll git him into. I dare say, Reddy thinks
Nolan’s his best friend. That’d be natural enough, since he’s got to
thinkin’ that all his old friends are his worst enemies.”</p>

<p>“If we could only find him!” said Allan, wistfully “and bring him home
again. The poor fellow will never get well if he’s left to wander about
like that.”</p>

<p>But there seemed no way of finding him. Allan was the last person who
had seen him. That was at the moment, in the early morning, when he had
slunk away from under the engine. Some warning of the search for him
must certainly have reached him, for he had never again appeared at
home. His wife, nearly heart-broken by the suspense, imagining him
suffering all sorts of hardships, yet went about her work with a calm
persistence which concealed in some degree the tumult which raged within
her. The children must be fed and cared for, and she permitted nothing
to stand between her and that duty. The division offices had never been
so clean as they were since Mrs. Magraw had taken charge of them.</p>

<p>A day or two later, Allan fancied he saw something which proved the
truth of Jack’s theory. It was one morning as he was returning from his
regular trip that he reached the embankment along the river and glanced
over at the willows on the farther side, as he always did when he passed
the place, for it was there that he and Jack had first seen Reddy in
Nolan’s company. His heart gave a leap as he saw two men there. He
stopped and looked at them, but the early morning mist rising from the
river hid them so that he could discern nothing beyond the mere outline
of their forms. He stared long and earnestly, until they passed behind
the clump of willows and disappeared from sight. Something told him that
it was Reddy and Nolan again, but he could not be sure, and at last he
went slowly on his way. Perhaps they had a place of concealment
somewhere in the woods that stretched eastward from the river-bank.</p>

<p>He mentioned his suspicion to Jack, as soon as he reached home, and the
latter was all on fire in a minute.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what we’ll do,” he said. “Next Sunday we’ll take a walk
through th’ woods over there, an’ it’s jest possible we’ll run on to
’em. Mebbe we kin save Reddy from that rascal yet!”</p>

<p>So, bright and early the next Sunday morning, they started out, taking
with them a lunch, for they did not expect to return until evening. They
crossed the river by the bridge which they had used on the night when
they had tried to capture Nolan, and struck at once into the woods.</p>

<p>“It’s like huntin’ a needle in a haystack,” said Jack, “but my idea is
that they’ve got a hut somewheres back in th’ hollers behind this first
range o’ hills. They’s mighty few houses back there,—nothin’ but woods.
So mebbe we’ll run on to ’em, if we have good luck.”</p>

<p>They scrambled up the first low range of hills which looked down upon
the broad river, and paused for a moment on the summit for a look about
them. Beyond the river lay the level valley which, twelve decades
before, had been one of the favourite dwelling-places of the red man.
The woods abounded with game of every sort, and the river with fish,
while in the fertile bottom his corn would grow to ripe luxuriance with
little cultivation. More than one fierce battle for the possession of
this smiling valley had been fought with the hardy bands of pioneers,
who had pushed their way up from the Ohio, but at last the advancing
tide of civilization swept the Indian aside, and the modern town of
Wadsworth began to rise where formerly there had been no building more
substantial than the hide wigwam.</p>

<p>Jack and Allan could see the town nestling among its trees in the wide
valley, but, when they turned about, a different view met them. To the
eastward were no plains, no bottoms, no city, but, far as the eye could
see, one hill rose behind another, all of them heavily wooded to the
very summit, so steep and with a soil so gravelly that no one had ever
attempted to cultivate them. Nor did any one dwell among them, save a
few poverty-stricken families, who lived in summer by picking
blackberries and in winter by digging sassafras-root,—a class of people
so shiftless and mean and dirty that no respectable farmer would permit
them on his place.</p>

<p>It was the rude cabin of one of these families which Jack and Allan saw
in the valley before them, and they determined to descend to it and make
inquiries. There was a rough path leading downwards through the woods,
and this they followed until they came to the edge of the little
clearing which surrounded the house. They went forward to the door and
knocked, but there was no response, and, after a moment, Jack pushed the
door open cautiously and looked inside. As he did so, a shot rang out
behind him, and Allan felt a sudden sting of pain across his cheek as a
bullet sang past and embedded itself in the jamb of the door.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” cried Jack, springing around, and then he saw Allan
wiping the blood from his cheek. “What is it, lad?” he asked, his face
paling. “You’re not hurted?”</p>

<p>“Only a scratch,” said Allan, smiling. “Just took a little of the skin
off.”</p>

<p>“Come in here an’ we’ll look at it,” and Jack half-dragged him through
the open door, which he closed and barred. “That’ll keep th’ varmint
from takin’ another shot at us,” he said. “Now let’s see the cheek.”</p>

<p>But not even Jack’s anxiety could make of the wound more than a scratch.
The bullet had cut the skin from the left cheek for nearly an inch, and
a little cold water, which Jack found in a bucket in the house, soon
stopped the bleeding.</p>

<p>“Who could it have been?” asked Allan, at last.</p>

<p>“Y’ don’t need t’ ask that, I hope,” cried Jack. “It was Dan Nolan!”</p>

<p>“Well, he didn’t hurt me much,” said Allan, with a laugh. “He doesn’t
seem to have very good luck.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Jack; “but if that bullet had been an inch further to th’
right, you wouldn’t be a-settin’ laughin’ there,” and a little shudder
ran through him as he thought of it, and he clinched his hands as he
imagined what his vengeance would have been.</p>

<p>“Do you suppose Nolan lives here?” asked Allan, looking curiously around
the room.</p>

<p>“No,” said Jack; “they’s one o’ th’ Waymores lives here, but I wouldn’t
be a bit surprised if he was in cahoots with Nolan. These people’re just
as much vagabonds as them that go trampin’ about th’ country.”</p>

<p>Allan looked again about the squalid room, and turned a little sick at
the thought of living in the midst of such filth and wretchedness.</p>

<p>“Come, let’s get out of here,” he said. “I want some fresh air. This is
enough to turn one’s stomach.”</p>

<p>“I tell you,” suggested Jack, “suppose we go out th’ back door there an’
sneak around th’ edge of th’ clearin’. Mebbe we kin come on Nolan when
he ain’t lookin’—and what I’ll do to him’ll be a plenty!”</p>

<p>Allan laughed at his ferocity.</p>

<p>“I don’t believe Nolan would stay around here,” he said. “He didn’t know
but what there were others with us. He probably decamped as soon as he
took that crack at me.”</p>

<p>“Well, it won’t do any harm t’ try,” said Jack, and try they did, but no
trace of Nolan was anywhere to be seen.</p>

<p>They went on through the woods, eating their lunch beside a limpid
spring which bubbled from beneath a rock in the hillside, and during the
afternoon pushed on along the valley, but met no human beings. If it was
indeed Nolan who fired the shot, he had taken to cover effectually.
Allan began to doubt more and more that it had really been Nolan.</p>

<p>“It might have been a hunter,” he pointed out to Jack, “who was shooting
at something else, and did not see us at all. Such things happen, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Jack admitted, “but that wasn’t what happened this time,” and,
when they reached home again, he went straight over to the offices and
related to Mr. Schofield the details of the morning’s adventures. That
official promised to put two detectives on Nolan’s trail at once. They
worked on it for two or three days, but, though they even employed a
bloodhound in the effort to run him down, all their work was quite in
vain. The man to whom the cabin belonged said he had walked over to a
neighbour’s that Sunday and had been away from home all day. He denied
all knowledge of Nolan or Reddy Magraw, And the search ended, as all the
others had done, without finding a trace of either of them.</p>

<p>So the days passed, and the work on section went on in its unvaried
round. And even from day to day Allan felt himself changing, as his
horizon broadened. He had become a different boy from the diffident
youngster who had asked Jack Welsh for a job that morning a few short
months before. Work had strengthened him and made him a man; he felt
immeasurably older; he had gained self-confidence; he felt that he could
look out for himself in any emergency. He was playing a man’s part in
the world; he was earning an honest living. He had gained friends, and
he began to feel that he had a future before him. He was going to make
the most of every opportunity, for he was ambitious, as every boy ought
to be. He longed to get into the superintendent’s office, where there
would be a chance to learn something about the infinitely difficult work
of operating the road, and where there would be a chance for promotion.
He never spoke of this to Jack, for such a thought seemed almost like
desertion, but he never passed the offices without looking longingly up
at the network of wires and signals. Sometimes, when some duty took him
up-stairs, he could hear the wild chatter of the instruments in the
despatchers’ office, and he determined to try to understand their
language.</p>

<p>Jack came into the section-shanty one morning with a sheet of paper in
his hand and a broad smile upon his face.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a Christmas gift fer y’, boys,” he said, and stuck the notice
up on the hook. They all crowded around to read it.</p>

</div>

<p>“All patrolling of the tracks will cease on and after December 25th
next. This company deeply appreciates the faithful service its
section-men have given it, and will endeavour to show that appreciation
by increasing the wages of all section-men ten per cent., to go into
effect January 1st.</p>

<div style='text-align:right; font-style:italic'>“Supt. and Gen. Manager.</div>

<p style='text-indent:0'><i>“Cincinnati, Ohio, Dec. 18th.”</i></p>

</div>

<p>“How’s that, boys?” asked Jack. “That’s a Christmas gift worth havin’,
ain’t it?” and he looked about from face to face, for he knew what that
increase of twelve and a half cents a day meant to these men. It meant
more food for the children, a new dress for the wife,—a little more
luxury and ease in lives which were hard enough at best.</p>

<hr class='tbk' />

<p>The weather had been cool and pleasant, but it changed as Christmas drew
near, and the twenty-fourth was marked by a heavy storm. All the
afternoon the rain fell in torrents, the wind blew a hurricane,
and—something rare for December—the lightning flashed and the thunder
rumbled savagely overhead.</p>

<p>Work was out of the question, and, after playing awhile with Mamie, and
telling her wonderful stories of Santa Claus and what he was going to
bring her that night, Jack Welsh mounted to his room to get a few hours
of much-needed rest. For his hours of patrol duty were from nine o’clock
to midnight, and this trying extra work was beginning to tell upon him.
With that characteristic unselfishness which endeared him to his men, he
had chosen the worst trick for himself.</p>

<p>“I’ll be mighty glad when this extry work’s over,” his wife remarked, as
she busied herself with the dishes in the kitchen, “fer all it pays
double. There’s no use fer a man t’ kill hisself jest t’ make a little
extry money. Jack’s purty nigh wore out;—just listen how he snores!”</p>

<p>Allan looked up at her and laughed from the place on the floor where he
was helping Mamie construct a castle out of painted blocks.</p>

<p>“We’ll let him sleep as long as we can,” he said; and so it was not till
nearly eight o’clock that Mamie was sent up-stairs to call him. They
heard him get heavily out of bed, and, while he was putting on his
clothes, Mary trimmed the lamp and stirred up the fire, in order that
everything might be bright and warm to welcome him. And Allan, watching
her, felt his eyes grow a little misty as he saw her loving
thoughtfulness.</p>

<p>“Better hurry up, Jack, dear,” she called. “You haven’t much time t’
spare.”</p>

<p>“Comin’, Mary, comin’,” he answered, “as soon as I git this plaguy boot
on.”</p>

<p>“It’s an awful night,” said his wife, as he came sleepily down the
stair. “Do you have t’ go, Jack? Can’t y’ stay home on Christmas Eve?”</p>

<p>“No, I have to go, Mary;” and he doused hands and face in a great basin
of rain-water. “It’s th’ last time, y’ know, an’ I ain’t a-goin’ t’
shirk now. Maybe th’ pay-car’ll come through t’-night. They promised us
our pay this month fer Christmas, y’ know, an’ we want to be sure that
she gits here all right. To-morrow we’ll have a great time, an’ they’ll
be no more patrol duty after that.”</p>

<p>Mamie danced around the floor, for she had received mysterious hints
from Allan of what was to happen on the morrow, and her father picked
her up and kissed her before he sat down to the supper that was on the
table awaiting him. He drank his coffee and ate his bacon and eggs with
an appetite born of good digestion. Then he donned his great boots and
rubber coat.</p>

<p>“Now, don’t y’ worry, Mary,” he said, drawing his wife to him. “There
won’t a drop of rain git to me in this rig. Good-bye, Mamie,” and he
picked up the child and kissed her again. “Take good care of ’em,
Allan.”</p>

<p>He rammed his wide leather hat down farther upon his head, made sure
that his lantern was burning properly, took up the heavy club he always
carried, and opened the door.</p>

<p>“Good-bye,” he called back, and in a moment had disappeared in the
darkness.</p>

</h2>

<p>Allan sat down by the table and picked up a book on telegraphy which he
had secured from the public library of Wadsworth, and which he was
studying faithfully in such odd hours as he had to himself,—without much
result, be it said, since he had no instrument to practise on,—while
Mrs. Welsh put the excited Mamie to bed, warning her to go to sleep at
once, lest she frighten Santa Claus away, and then went slowly about the
task of clearing up the supper dishes and putting the house in order for
the morrow.</p>

<p>“An’ we’ll hev t’ set up th’ Christmas tree to-night,” she remarked.
“It’ll hev t’ be ready when Mamie wakes up in th’ mornin’, an’ she’ll
wake mighty early.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Allan; “as soon as you’re ready, tell me.”</p>

<p>That morning, on his way in from his trip, he had stopped to cut a
little evergreen in a grove near the track, and this had been safely
deposited in the cellar, out of the reach of Mamie’s curious eyes. Long
strings of snow-white pop-corn had been threaded, streamers of
bright-coloured tissue-paper prepared, little red and blue candles
bought; all of which, together with the presents and parti-coloured
candies, would make the tree in Mamie’s eyes a veritable fairy picture.
It was her first Christmas tree, and it was to be a splendid one!</p>

<p>“Now I’m ready, Allan,” said Mrs. Welsh, at last; and Allan laid aside
his book and brought up the tree from the cellar, while Mrs. Welsh
unlocked the closet where the ornaments and gifts had been carefully
hidden. “We’ll set it up in that corner by th’ winder,” she continued;
“then th’ people that goes by outside kin see it, too.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad I’m going to be here when Mamie first sees it,” said Allan, as
he nailed some cross-pieces on the bottom of the tree to hold it
upright. “I’d be out on my trick if it hadn’t been for that order.”</p>

<p>“Yes, an’ I’m glad, too,” agreed Mrs. Welsh. “That patrol work was hard
on all o’ you. But this trip o’ Jack’s t’-night’ll be th’ last that any
o’ th’ gang on Twenty-one has t’ make. I only wish th’ patrollin’ had
ended to-day instead o’ to-morrer, then Jack’d be here with us now
instead of out in that howlin’ storm.”</p>

<p>They listened a moment to the wind whistling about the house, and to the
rain lashing savagely against the windows.</p>

<p>“It is a bad night,” said Allan, “but Jack won’t mind it. He’ll be
thinking of the good time he’s going to have to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad it’s th’ last time, anyway,—fer your sake, too, Allan.
Jack an’ me used t’ worrit ourselves nearly sick when you’d start out
alone that way. We never knowed what’d happen.”</p>

<p>“And nothing ever happened, after all!” laughed Allan. “I believe that
Dan Nolan has forgotten all about me long before this.”</p>

<p>Mary shook her head doubtfully.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” she said. “But anyway it won’t matter now, for you’ll
allers be with th’ gang after this, an’ Nolan won’t dare show his nose
around where they are. Jack’s just achin’ t’ lay hands on him.”</p>

<p>“There,” said Allan, as he drove the last nail, “that’s solid, I think,”
and he set the tree up in the corner. “Now, what next?”</p>

<p>“All these things has got t’ have little ribbons tied to ’em,” said Mrs.
Welsh, who had been getting out the candy, fruits, and presents. “But I
kin do that. You set down an’ read your book.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I won’t!” protested the boy. “I want to feel that I’ve had
something to do with this tree,” and he drew a chair up to the table.</p>

<p>“Somethin’ t’ do with it!” retorted Mary. “You’ve had everything t’ do
with it, I’m a-thinkin’. It’s your Christmas tree, Allan, an’ mighty
nice of you to think of it, my boy.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I wanted Mamie to have one,” he protested; “especially when it was
so little trouble to get. Now it’s ready for the pop-corn.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Welsh began to drape the white festoons about the tree. Suddenly
she paused and looked up with startled eyes.</p>

<p>“What was that?” she asked.</p>

<p>Allan listened with strained attention, but heard only the dashing of
the rain and whistling of the wind.</p>

<p>“It sounded like the trampin’ of men,” she said, after a moment.
“Perhaps it wasn’t anything. Yes! There it is ag’in!”</p>

<p>She sprang to the door and threw it open with frenzied haste. Up the
path she saw dimly four men advancing, staggering under a burden. Her
love told her what the burden was.</p>

<p>“It’s Jack!” she screamed. “It’s Jack! My God! They’ve killed him!” and,
forgetting the storm, she sprang down the path toward them.</p>

<p>“Is he dead?” she demanded. “Tell me quick—is he dead?”</p>

<p>It was Jack’s hearty voice that answered her.</p>

<p>“Not by a good deal, Mary! It’ll take more’n a twisted ankle t’ kill
Jack Welsh!”</p>

<p>She threw her arms about him, sobbing wildly in her great relief, the
men standing by, awkwardly supporting him.</p>

<p>“But there! Here I am keepin’ you out in th’ wet! Bring him in, men,”
and she ran on before, radiant with happiness. This misfortune was so
much less than she had feared, that it seemed almost not to be a
misfortune at all. “It’s only a sprained ankle, Allan,” she cried to the
boy, and ran on past him to get a chair ready.</p>

<p>The men settled the foreman down into the chair cautiously.</p>

<p>“Shall I git th’ doctor?” asked one.</p>

<p>Jack laughed.</p>

<p>“Th’ doctor, indade!” he said. “Mary’ll fix this all right in no time.
It ain’t bad. But I’m much obliged to ye, boys.”</p>

<p>The men took themselves back to work, happier, somehow, for having
witnessed the little scene on the pathway.</p>

<p>But when the boot was cut away from the swollen ankle, it was evident
that its owner would not go about on it again for many days to come. It
was bathed and rubbed with liniment and tightly bandaged by the wife’s
deft fingers, and the pain gradually grew less.</p>

<p>“I slipped on a rail, y’ see,” explained Jack, when the injured member
had been properly cared for.</p>

<p>“My foot went down into a frog, an’ then I had t’ fall over and wrench
it. I’m sorry it give y’ such a turn, Mary; I ought t’ have sent a man
on ahead t’ warn you.”</p>

<p>Mary smiled down on him indulgently.</p>

<p>“’Twas better this way, Jack, dear,” she said. “I’m so happy now t’ have
y’ alive here talkin’ t’ me that it hardly seems you’ve met with an
accident at all! See, we was jest gittin’ th’ Christmas tree ready; now
you kin set there, with your foot up on a chair like this and boss th’
job. It’s an ill wind that blows nobody good; and I’m glad fer your own
sake. Now you won’t have to go out in th’ storm.”</p>

<p>But, at the words, the foreman’s face suddenly changed.</p>

<p>“Good heavens!” he cried. “I fergot! Th’ track has t’ be patrolled.
Somebody has t’ go,” and he raised himself in his chair, but fell back
with a groan. “No use,” he muttered, between his clenched teeth.
“To-night, too, when th’ pay-car’ll most probably come through! Allan,
you’ll have t’ run over t’ th’ train-master, an’ git him t’ send
somebody else.”</p>

<p>“Mr. Schofield went to Cincinnati this morning, I think,” answered
Allan. “I saw him getting on the train as I came in from the road.”</p>

<p>“O’ course!” cried Jack, fiercely. “He’s gone down t’ come back with th’
pay-car. Well, hunt up th’ chief despatcher, then; somebody’s got t’
patrol that track.”</p>

<p>Without a word, Allan donned the foreman’s rubber coat and great hat.
Then he picked up the heavy club and the red signal-lantern, which was
standing, still lighted, on the table, where one of the men had placed
it.</p>

<p>“What y’ goin’ t’ do with that?” demanded Jack, eying the boy uneasily.
“Y’ don’t need that to go to th’ depot with.”</p>

<p>“No,” said Allan, smiling, “but you see, I’m not going to the depot. I’m
going to take your trick.”</p>

<p>“No, you ain’t!” cried the other, fiercely.</p>

<p>“Yes, I am. There’s nobody else to be got at this time of night;
besides, you said yourself there’s no danger.”</p>

<p>Jack looked at him a moment doubtfully.</p>

<p>“No, I don’t think there is,” he said at last. “But it’s a bad night.”</p>

<p>“Pooh!” and Allan whirled his club disdainfully. “Not a drop of water
can get to me in this rig,” he added, echoing Jack’s words.</p>

<p>“Anyway,” said the latter, hesitatingly, “y’ll be back in three hours,
an’ you kin sleep late in the mornin’. I don’t see no other way,” he
added, with a sigh.</p>

<p>“All right,” said Allan; “good-bye,” and went to the door.</p>

<p>But Mrs. Welsh ran after him, threw her arms about his neck and kissed
him.</p>

<p>“You’re a good boy, Allan,” she cried, half-sobbing. “I’ll have a good
hot meal fer you when y’ git back.”</p>

<p>Allan laughed.</p>

<p>“I’ll be ready for it. Be sure to make a good job of that Christmas
tree! Good-bye,” and he opened the door and strode out into the night.</p>

</h2>

<p>But the storm was not to be dismissed so lightly as Allan had dismissed
it. Among the houses of the town he was sheltered somewhat, but, as he
strode on westward, out into the open country, it seemed to rage with
redoubled violence. The wind swept across the embankment along the river
with a fury which threatened to blow him away. He bent low before it,
and, swinging his lantern from right to left in unison with his steps,
fought his way slowly onward, his eyes on the track. Away down at his
right he could hear the river raging, and from instant to instant the
lightning disclosed to him glimpses of the storm-tossed water. Once he
saw a ball of fire roll down the track far ahead and finally leap off,
shattering into a thousand fragments.</p>

<p>The thunder crashed incessantly, and overhead he could see great black
clouds rolling across the sky. The rain fell in torrents, and, driven
before the wind, dashed into his face with a violence which stung and
blinded him whenever he raised his head. From time to time, he was
forced to face about, his back to the wind, and gasp for breath. Once a
gust of extra violence drove him to his knees, but he struggled up again
and on. He knew that he was not the only one who was facing the tempest;
he knew that up and down two hundred miles of track others were fighting
the same fight. They had left warm homes, just as he had done, where
preparations for Christmas were going on; they had not held back from
the call of duty, nor would he.</p>

<p>He shut his teeth tight together and staggered on. A vision flashed
before him of the bright room he had just left; he could see Jack
sitting in his chair, and Mary putting the last touches to the Christmas
tree. He knew that they were talking of him, planning for him, and a
sudden wave of tenderness swept over him at the thought of how these
people had taken him into their hearts and given him another home in
place of the one he had lost. The new one, of course, could never quite
take the place of the old one; and yet he was no longer the friendless,
hungry, lonely boy who had approached Jack Welsh so timidly that morning
and asked for work. He had friends to whom he could look for sympathy
and encouragement; there were hearts which loved him; he had a place in
the world and was doing useful work; and he hoped in time to prove
himself worthy of a higher place and competent to fill it. To-morrow
would be a happy Christmas!</p>

<p>So, as he fought his way on, it was with no despondent heart, but with a
bright and hopeful one, that cared nothing for the discomfort of the
storm. He was happy and at peace within, and no mere external tempest
could disturb him!</p>

<p>A little grove on either side the track, its trees roaring in the
tempest, gave him a moment’s shelter. Then he pushed on to the two iron
bridges which spanned the canal and the highroad just beyond it. These
he looked over carefully by the light of his lantern, and assured
himself that they were all right. Beyond the bridges was the long grade
which led to the deep cut through the spur of hill which stretched
across the track, and here the wind was howling with a fury that
threatened to sweep him off his feet. But he fought his way on doggedly,
step by step, head lowered, eyes on the track, lantern swinging from
side to side.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the wind ceased, though he could still hear it roaring far
overhead, and he looked up to see that he had gained the cover of the
cut. He stopped for breath, rejoicing that the hardest part of his task
was over. Beyond the cut was a sharp curve, the road was carried on a
high trestle over a deep ravine, and then onward along the top of an
embankment,—a “fill,” in railroad parlance,—and this embankment marked
the western limit of his trick. On his journey home, he would have the
wind at his back and could get along easily and rapidly.</p>

<p>Cheered by this thought, he walked on through the cut, but, as he turned
the corner at the farther side, the wind struck him again with terrific
force. He staggered back for an instant against the rock, when there
came a great flash of lightning that silhouetted before him every
feature of the landscape. Yet, as the lightning died, there remained
photographed on his brain only one detail of the picture,—before him
stretched the trestle, and in the middle of it four men were working
with feverish energy tearing up a rail!</p>

<p>He leaned back against the rock, dazed at the sight, not understanding
for a moment what it meant. Then in a flash its meaning dawned upon
him—they were preparing to wreck a train. But what train? It must be
nearly eleven o’clock—no train was due for an hour or more—yes, there
was—the pay-car, hurrying from Cincinnati with the Christmas money for
the men. It was the pay-car they were after. But the pay-car was always
crowded with armed men—men armed not merely with revolvers, but with
Winchester repeaters. Yet, let the car crash over that trestle fifty
feet upon the rocks below, and how many of its occupants would be living
to defend themselves?</p>

<p>Allan sank back among the rocks trembling, realizing that in some way he
must save the train. His first act was to open his lantern and
extinguish it, lest it betray him. Then he tried quickly to think out a
plan of action. He must get across the trestle in order to flag the
train—but how could he get across it? And of a sudden his heart stood
still as two vague forms loomed up before him. They stopped for a moment
in the shelter of the wall.</p>

<p>“It was just about here,” said a rough voice he seemed to recognize. “I
caught a glint of a red light an’ then it went out. I was watchin’ fer
the track-walker, y’ know, an’ I was sure that was him.”</p>

<p>“Flash o’ lightnin’, most likely,” came in a hoarse undertone from
another.</p>

<p>Allan heard the newcomers grope about, as he cowered close to the rock,
his heart beating fiercely as he expected each moment to feel a hand
upon him.</p>

<p>“Y’ see they ain’t nobody here,” said the first speaker, at last.</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented the other, uncertainly. “But he’s about due, if he’s
comin’.”</p>

<p>“I dunno,” protested the other. “Y’d better not bank on that.”</p>

<p>“I ain’t a-bankin’ on it!” retorted his companion, impatiently. “You’re
goin’ t’ keep a lookout, ain’t you? Now I’ll go on back an’ you stay
right here. You kin see a long stretch down th’ track from here, so they
can’t surprise us. If they’s more’n one, warn us,—maybe they’ve put on a
double guard t’-night,—but, if they’s only one, wait here behind this
rock, an’ when he comes past, do fer him—’specially if it’s Welsh ’r th’
kid. It’s about time we was gittin’ even!”</p>

<p>Allan’s heart leaped. He knew the voice now—there was no mistaking—it
was Nolan’s!</p>

<p>Nolan started back toward the trestle through the storm and was lost to
sight instantly, while the sentry sat down upon a rock to watch the
track, whistling to himself, as though train-wrecking were the most
ordinary thing in the world. But Allan was thinking only of one thing—he
must get past that man on the rock, he must cross the ravine, he must
flag the train.</p>

<p>That was his duty lying clear before him. Danger? Yes,—but which of his
comrades would stop to think of that? Yet he must be careful,—not for
his own sake, but for the sake of those who were speeding toward this
peril. He must run no risk of failure, for their lives depended upon
him—upon his coolness, his foresight, his quickness. And whatever he did
must be done at once. He gripped his hands together to still their
trembling. Come,—this was no time for weakness. He must prove himself a
man! He must prove himself worthy the service of the road!</p>

<p>He could not climb the well-nigh perpendicular side of the cut; to go
back and work his way over the hill would require too much time—and
there was not a moment to be lost. The only thing to do, then, was to go
forward. He drew a deep breath; then he tucked his lantern snugly under
his left arm, grasped his club firmly, and moved forward cautiously,
hugging the side of the cut, his eyes on the sentry.</p>

<p>Once he stumbled heavily over some obstruction, but the storm covered
the noise, and the sentry made no sign that he had heard, but sat
twirling a heavy stick and looking down the track. Hope began to revive
in the boy’s breast; perhaps he might be able to steal past unseen.
Lower and lower he crouched; slow and more slowly he moved; he was
almost past—almost past—</p>

<p>Then, of a sudden, a broad flash of lightning flared down into the cut
and revealed them to each other.</p>

<p>“Reddy!” cried the boy. “Reddy!”</p>

<p>The sentry sprang toward him with uplifted club, his face distorted with
rage.</p>

<p>“Don’t you know me, Reddy?” cried Allan, springing back to avoid the
blow.</p>

<p>“Sure Oi knows y’!” shouted the madman, savagely, coming on. “An’ Oi’m
a-goin’ t’ do fer y’, like Dan told me to. He told me y’re all in th’
plot ag’in me!”</p>

<p>“It’s a lie, Reddy!” protested Allan, violently. “It’s a lie!”</p>

<p>Reddy paused for an instant.</p>

that link motion?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” admitted the boy; “but—”</p>

<p class='caption'>“HE STEPPED TO ONE SIDE, AND ... BROUGHT DOWN HIS CLUB UPON THE OTHER’S HEAD”</p>
</div>

<p>Reddy waited to hear no more.</p>

<p>“Oi knowed it!” he yelled. “Oi knowed it! Oi’ll show you! Oi’ll show
you, y’ dirty spy! Don’t try t’ run—it’s no use!”</p>

<p>And he came charging down upon Allan, his club swinging savagely.</p>

<p>But Allan was thinking not in the least of running. Instead, he stood
his ground, his teeth clenched, his eyes alert, his club ready. He was
not in the least excited; now, indeed, he found an instant in which to
wonder at his calmness. Then Reddy was upon him and struck at him
savagely. He stepped to one side, and, putting all his force into the
blow,—oh, how he hated to do it!—brought down his club upon the other’s
head.</p>

  <span style='font-size:1.2em'>CHAPTER XVIII.</span><br /><span style='font-size:1.0em'>THE SIGNAL IN THE NIGHT</span>
</h2>

<p>That blow had all the weight of Allan’s muscular young body behind it,
for he had realized that this was no moment to hold his hand, however he
might wish to do so, and Reddy tumbled in a limp heap upon the track.</p>

<p>The tears were gushing from the boy’s eyes as he bent over the body and
drew it to one side to the shelter of the rock. That he should have
struck Reddy—perhaps even killed him! But he could not linger; with a
last glance at the prostrate figure, he turned back to the task before
him.</p>

<p>Plainly he could not hope to cross the trestle with half a dozen men
working on it—to try to do so would mean certain failure. Yet he must
cross the ravine,—there was only one other way, and that not an easy
one.</p>

<p>He threw off Jack’s waterproof, which would only impede him now that he
needed the utmost freedom of movement, and, holding his lantern tight,
he jumped from the track and half-scrambled, half-fell down the steep
descent below him, disregarding mud and brambles, torn clothes, and
bruises, thinking only of one thing—that he must reach the other side
and save the train. In a moment he was at the bottom, bruised and
breathless, but luckily with no bones broken. Then for an instant he
paused. Through the bottom of the ravine ran a stream, usually a gentle,
shallow brook, but now swollen to an angry torrent by the pouring rain.
There was no time for hesitation—no time to seek a better place—indeed,
that was impossible in the darkness—and, holding his lantern high above
his head, the boy dashed into the water.</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed that he must be swept away, so fierce was the
rush of the torrent; but he got his feet, braced himself against it, and
inch by inch fought his way across. The water tore at him and raged
around him, hissing and sputtering, determined that he should not
escape. Well for him that he had had those months of work on section,
which had strengthened muscle and steadied nerve—which had taught him
how to fight!</p>

<p>So, at last, he won through to the farther bank, breathless, exhausted,
triumphant. And here a new difficulty met him. He had shut himself into
a trap from which there seemed no escaping. Again and again he tried to
climb the steep side of the ravine, but as many times slipped down to
the bottom, bringing with him an avalanche of earth and loose stones.</p>

<p>Dry sobs rose in his throat and choked him as he lay for a moment
against the bank, weak and trembling. Was he to be defeated here, with
the end almost in sight? Was he to fail, after all? Must he stay here to
witness the train take that awful plunge from the trestle down into the
torrent beneath? He looked up with a shudder. High above him, he could
see the trestle dimly outlined against the sky, and he knew that the
work of tearing up the rail must be almost done.</p>

<p>He shook the weakness from him—he must be a man!—and he shut his eyes as
he tried to picture to himself how the place looked by daylight. He had
crossed the trestle a hundred times and gazed down into the ravine,
admiring its rugged beauty. For centuries that little stream, which
started in a spring high up on the hillside, had been labouring
patiently digging this channel for itself, eating its way through earth
and rock and slate, fashioning for itself a little narrow valley, just
as the great streams make for themselves broad and fertile ones. It had
eaten its way down and down, leaving on either side, extending to a
height of nearly a hundred feet, rocky and precipitous banks. Allan
remembered how in summer those banks were clothed in green; how he had
looked down at them from the trestle. One day he had descried a
brilliant patch of wild flowers near the bottom, where they had grown
and spread, safe from man’s intrusion. He had never thought how much
would one day depend upon his knowledge of the place, or he would have
examined the banks more closely.</p>

<p>Something swished through the air above him, and fell with a mighty
splash into the torrent—it was the rail—it had been torn loose—the
wreckers’ work was done. Now, they had only to wait until the train came
dashing past! Perhaps even at this moment it was nearing the destruction
which threatened it! The boy shuddered at the thought, and made another
vain and desperate effort to scramble up the bank. This time he managed
to get hold of a little bush high above his head, but, as he was pulling
himself up, the bush gave way and he fell again to the bottom. He
realized that he could never hope to climb that treacherous bank, that
he must follow the ravine until it grew wider and shallower. Yet how
could he do that and still be in time to save the train? There must be
some way out near at hand! The robbers must have provided some path by
which to get down to the wrecked train and get up again with their
booty. But no doubt the path, if there was one, was on the other side of
the ravine, where it would be of no use to him; very probably there was
no path at all. The robbers had merely to let down a rope to provide a
means of entrance and exit. He would have to go around, and he started
blindly forward down the stream, holding his lantern tight, trembling to
think of the precious moments he had wasted,—of the ones that he must
yet waste before he could gain the track above and warn the engineer of
the peril which lay before him. It was a desperate chance, but it seemed
the only one.</p>

<p>He groped his way stumblingly along, walking in the edge of the water,
making such progress as he could; slipping, falling full length once or
twice, but rising again and pressing forward. His teeth were chattering,
for the icy water had chilled him to the bone, but he seemed not to be
conscious of the cold; his hands and face were cut and bleeding,
scratched by brambles and by the sharp edges of rocks and slate, but he
did not feel the sting of the wounds. He was thinking only of one
thing—he must get out of this trap—he must flag the train! There must be
some way out! He could not fail now!</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, he remembered. Just below the trestle, a little stream,
rushing down the hillside to join the torrent below, had cut for itself
a miniature ravine in the side of the larger one. He had noticed it one
day not long before—had noticed its rocky bed, which rose steeply to the
fields above, but not so steeply as the sides of the ravine itself. Here
was a way up which he might escape, if he could only find it. It must be
somewhere near,—and he groped his way along, faltering, stumbling,—and
at last he found the cut.</p>

<p>Yet it was not so easy of ascent as he had thought it would be; for the
water was rushing headlong down it, threatening to sweep him back at
every moment. Still he clambered on, digging knees and elbows into the
mud, holding with desperate strength to the bushes that grew by the way,
using every rock for foothold, up and up, until, at last, wet to the
skin, with clothing torn and body cut, covered with mud, bruised and
aching, but glowing with triumphant excitement, he reached the top.</p>

<p>He knew the railroad was somewhere to the right, and he stumbled forward
as fast as his trembling legs would carry him. More than once he tripped
and fell heavily over a log or stone, but always he held tight his
precious lantern, not minding his own bruises so that it was safe. And
at last, with a great joy at his heart, he saw, stretching dimly ahead
of him, the high embankment upon which rested the track.</p>

<p>He sat down for a moment to take breath, then reached into his trousers
pocket and drew out his match-safe. It was a company safe, and
waterproof, for often the fate of a train depended on whether a
watchman’s matches were wet or dry, and for this, at least, the company
had the foresight to provide. Crouching in the shelter of the
embankment, he found a little rock, and, holding it under his coat,
struck a match against it. A gust of wind caught it instantly and blew
it out. With trembling fingers, he struck another match, which sputtered
feebly for a second, flared up and was extinguished; but the third match
burned for a moment, and he applied it quickly to the wick of the
lantern. How the red glare warmed and cheered him as he snapped the
globe back into place! He was in time to save the train!</p>

<p>Then he sprang to his feet. For away down the track before him came the
sudden glare of a headlight, as the engine swung around a curve, and the
hum of the wheels told that the engineer was speeding through the night,
with throttle wide open, anxious, no doubt, to get safely into the haven
of the yards at Wadsworth.</p>

<p>Up the bank scrambled the boy and down the track he ran, as fast as his
feet would carry him, swinging his lantern in great circles over his
head. He knew that the engineer must see it; he knew that on such a
night as this his eyes would be turned not an instant from the track.</p>

<p>Then, suddenly, from behind him, there came the sharp crack of a
revolver, and his lantern was smashed to pieces in his hand. He wheeled
to see a flash of flame, as the revolver spoke again; the world reeled
before him, turned black, and a great blow seemed to strike him in the
chest and bear him down.</p>

</h2>

<p>Bill Johnson, engineer of the 187, pulling the pay-car, stared out into
the night, his hand on the throttle. The long gleam of the headlight
shot out through the driving rain, and he could see the wet rails
gleaming far ahead. He was making a record run; the superintendent had
given him some hint of his fear for the safety of the pay-car, and he
heaved a sigh of relief as the train swung around a curve and hurtled
down the fill on the straightaway course for Wadsworth. Once in the
yards there, the pay-car would be safe.</p>

<p>Then, with a quick gasp, he closed the throttle, reversed the engine,
and threw on the brakes, for, far down the track ahead of him he had
caught the gleam of a red lantern waved twice in the air. The light had
vanished mysteriously in full flight, but a single glimpse of it was
warning enough for Johnson.</p>

<p>The moment the brakes were applied, the detectives, back in the pay-car,
had grabbed down the Winchesters from the wall and made ready for a
fight. It might be that the engineer had sighted an obstruction on the
track, and they waited instant by instant to feel the car leave the
rails. It stopped with a jerk, and the detectives piled out, ready for
anything.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter?” they asked, coming to the spot where Johnson was
leaning out of his cab window.</p>

<p>“Somebody flagged me a minute ago,” answered Johnson, still peering out
through the night. “It’s funny he don’t come ahead an’ tell us what’s
th’ trouble.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it’s a trick to get us away from the car,” said somebody, and the
detectives faced about in the darkness, instinctively bracing themselves
to receive a volley of bullets.</p>

<p>“Climb up here in th’ cab,” suggested Johnson, “an’ I’ll go ahead slow,
an’ find out what’s th’ matter.”</p>

<p>They climbed up instantly, and the engine crept slowly ahead, while they
all peered out through the dashing rain, expecting they knew not what.</p>

<p>“There’s somethin’ on th’ track,” cried Johnson, after a moment, his
trained eyes catching the first glimpse of a dim obstruction. “It’s a
man!” he said. “It’s th’ track-walker. Somebody done fer him jest as he
was signallin’ me! That’s why his lantern went out!”</p>

<p>The men ran forward, Mr. Schofield among them. In the white glare of the
headlight, they could see a form stretched heavily across the track,
lying on its face.</p>

<p>One of the men turned it over.</p>

<p>“My God! It’s young West!” cried Mr. Schofield, and dropped on his knee
beside him.</p>

<p>“And shot through the breast,” added one of the detectives, indicating
the growing blood-stain upon the boy’s shirt.</p>

<p>They carried him tenderly back to the pay-car and laid him on a cot
there. His right hand still grasped the handle of his shattered lantern,
holding it so tightly that they could not remove it. Mr. Schofield
himself did what he could to stop the flow of blood; then went forward
cautiously to investigate. In the centre of the trestle, they found that
a rail had been torn from the track.</p>

<p>“There’s where we’d have been by this time but for that boy,” said Mr.
Schofield, in a low voice, and motioned toward the abyss, his face set
and livid. “How he got past the wreckers I can’t imagine. Now I want you
men to run down the fiends who did this. We’ve got to have them, no
matter what it costs! Now get after them! I’ll get this rail back—don’t
bother about that—and take the pay-car in. You fellows catch these
scoundrels!”</p>

<p>The detectives hurried away into the night, while Mr. Schofield called
the train-crew, got out an extra rail which was always kept by the side
of the bridge, and soon had it spiked into place.</p>

<p>“Now go ahead, Johnson,” he called to the engineer, “but you’d better
run slow—maybe there’s another rail loose somewhere,” and he swung
himself up the steps of the pay-car and sat down by Allan’s cot, with a
very grim face.</p>

<p>But let Johnson, the engineer, tell the rest of the story, as he told it
to a group of interested auditors the very next day in the roundhouse
office.</p>

<p>“I tell you, I run over that trestle mighty cautious-like,” he said,
“an’ it give me a turn when I looked down into that ditch an’ thought of
what would have happened if th’ boy hadn’t flagged us. But we got across
all right, an’ started through th’ cut, still runnin’ slow, fer I didn’t
know but what there might be a rock on the track, when I heard somebody
hollerin’ at me, an’ in a minute up comes Reddy Magraw climbin’ into th’
cab, lookin’ crazier ’n ever.</p>

<p>“‘How did I git out here?’ he asked, wild-like. ‘Who fetched me out
here? What ’m I doin’ ’way out here?’</p>

<p>“‘If you don’t know, I don’t,’ says I. ‘Set down there an’ rest. What’s
th’ matter with your head?’ I asked, fer I saw it was all bloody on one
side.</p>

<p>“Reddy put his hand up and felt of his head; then he took his hand down
an’ looked at the blood on it.</p>

<p>“‘I dunno,’ he says. ‘Mebbe th’ engine hit me. Where’s Welsh an’ the
rest o’ th’ gang? They oughtn’t to have gone off an’ left me layin’ out
here like this,—I didn’t think they’d do that!’</p>

<p>“‘What engine hit you?’ I asked.</p>

<p>“‘Why, th’ engine o’ Number Four,’ he says. ‘I didn’t have time t’ git
out of th’ road after I threw th’ switch. But I didn’t think th’ boys’d
’a’ left me layin’ out here like this. Why, I might ’a’ died!’</p>

<p>“Well, sir, it come to me all in a minute that somehow Reddy Magraw had
got his senses back, an’ I tell you it set me a-tremblin’ jest like th’
time my wife had her first baby. I was purty nigh scared to death!</p>

<p>“‘I guess th’ engine must ’a’ hit you, sure,’ I says, to ease him up.
Then, as th’ track was clear, I opened up my engine, while Magraw set on
the floor of th’ cab in a dazed sort of way. Never a word did he say
till we pulled into the yards.</p>

<p>“‘You’d better see a doctor,’ I says. But he jumped off th’ engine th’
minute we stopped.</p>

<p>“‘I don’t want no doctor,’ he says. ‘I’m goin’ home.’ An’ he started off
on a run.</p>

<p>“Well, you orter seen Mr. Schofield when I told him. He went along with
th’ boy, an’ seen him fixed up, an’ then hurried away with th’ doctor t’
see Reddy. An’ he found him at home with his wife on one knee an’ his
children on th’ other,—he told us when he got back.”</p>

<p>Johnson stopped, took out his handkerchief, and mopped his eyes openly.</p>

<p>“I don’t keer,” he said, looking around defiantly. “It’s enough t’ make
any man’s eyes wet t’ think of what that family’s been through, an’ now
Reddy’s give back to ’em ag’in with a head’s good as anybody’s. Why, it
beats anything I ever heard of!”</p>

<p>And, indeed, it was a nine-days’ wonder to every one. The doctors came
and looked at him and explained what had happened in many learned words,
and one of them wrote a paper about it, which he read before a medical
society; the newspapers heard of it and wrote it up, and published
Reddy’s photograph,—why, Mrs. Magraw has all those papers put carefully
away, and she gets them out occasionally even yet, and reads them and
cries over them,—but they are tears of happiness and thanksgiving. For
Reddy was as well as ever, and the gist of all the learned medical
opinions was that the blow on the head which Allan dealt him had somehow
set right the brain disordered by the blow it had received from the
engine months before. It did for him just what an operation might have
done, and did it effectually. How it had done it, the doctors couldn’t
say, and there were many warm discussions over it. It was not without
precedent,—not unfrequently a case of the same kind is reported,—but the
righting of that delicate mechanism, the brain, is something that no
physician, be he never so famous, as yet thoroughly understands.</p>

<p>The one fact remained that Reddy was himself again, and freed for ever
from the influence of Dan Nolan. And, indeed, Nolan himself was destined
to pay the penalty for his iniquities. For the detectives soon found the
trail of him and his companions; the help of the Wadsworth police force
was secured, a bloodhound was brought to the scene, and all that night
the pursuit was kept up among the hills. When morning dawned, the quarry
was run to cover in an old log hut near the top of Mount Logan, and the
detectives and police surrounded it.</p>

<p>The robbers put up a short fight, but they saw they had no chance to
escape, and the bullets from the Winchesters were whistling through the
cabin in a most unnerving way, so they waved a white rag out of one of
the windows and surrendered. There were four in the party, Nolan and
three tramps whom nobody knew. They were taken back to Wadsworth and
lodged safely in jail there, leaving it only to go to the State
penitentiary at Columbus to serve a term of years. Nolan broke down at
the last, like the great coward he really was, confessed, plead guilty,
and turned State’s evidence against his comrades in order to save
himself a year or two of imprisonment. So that was the end of Nolan for
a time; but his power for mischief was not yet at an end, and he later
involved some of his old associates in new disasters—but that story
cannot be told here.</p>

</h2>

<p>It was only a memory now, that gray, wet Christmas morning when Allan
had been brought home pale and limp, on a stretcher. They had started
from bed at the first tap on the door, for his prolonged absence had
begun to worry them, and Jack, unheeding his sprained ankle, had hobbled
to it and flung it open. He stood silent as they brought the boy in and
set the stretcher on the floor. He watched the doctor strip back his
clothing, remove the rude bandage that had been hastily placed over the
wound, wipe away the blood, and begin to probe for the bullet. Mary,
too, had thrown on her gown and stood watching the operation with white
face.</p>

<p>“Doctor,” burst out Jack, at last, almost fiercely, “don’t tell me he’s
dead! Don’t tell me he’s goin’ t’ die! He saved my little girl. Don’t
tell me I let him go t’ his death!”</p>

<p>“He’ll not die,” said the doctor, reassuringly. “The bullet seems to
have been deflected from its course and to have made only a bad flesh
wound.”</p>

<p>But it turned the watchers sick to see the probe sink in deeper and
deeper. Suddenly the surgeon gave a little exclamation and ran his hand
under the boy’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Here,” he said to his assistant, “turn him over.”</p>

<p>He made a quick cut with a knife under the shoulder-blade, and a little
flattened piece of lead fell into his hand.</p>

<p>“There’s the bullet,” and he handed it to Welsh. “Maybe he’ll want it
for a keepsake.” And he proceeded skilfully to bandage up the wound.</p>

<p>But it was not until Allan opened his eyes and smiled faintly up at them
that Jack and Mary believed that he could live. They fell on their knees
beside his bed, but the doctor hurried them away.</p>

<p>“What he needs now is sleep,” he said. “Let him sleep as long as he
can.”</p>

<p>“But look at his poor face, doctor,” whispered Mary, “an’ at his hands,
all tore and scratched. Do ye suppose them devils did that to him, too?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” said the doctor. “Those scratches won’t hurt him; it’s
that wound in the breast that’s dangerous. Now, let him sleep.”</p>

<p>And sleep he did, all through that Christmas Day. The story of his
exploit had got about, and a constant stream of railroad men came softly
up the path to ask how he was doing, and to stand around afterward and
discuss the story. All night he slept, with Mary watching by his
bedside, and, when he opened his eyes next morning, she was still
sitting there.</p>

<p>The doctor came an hour later, looked at the wound, felt his pulse, and
nodded encouragingly.</p>

<p>“He’ll pull through all right,” he said. “He’s got a little fever, but
that was to be expected. But he’s in first-class shape and will soon
rally from that wound. Keep him quiet for a day or two.”</p>

<p>Before that time, the fever had subsided, the wound was healing nicely,
and the doctor pronounced his patient out of danger.</p>

<p>“He’s pretty weak,” he said, “and must take things easy. Don’t let him
strain himself any way, or he may open the wound. Keep him quiet and
cheerful—his youth will do the rest.”</p>

<p>How they vied with one another to nurse Allan back to strength again.
Reddy, his old self, was the first caller, with his heart going out to
the boy with a love that was well-nigh worship.</p>

<p>“I don’t know nothin’ ’bout how it happened, Allan,” he said, wringing
the hand of the white-faced boy, “but I think I can count on y’ not to
be layin’ it up ag’in me.”</p>

<p>Allan leaned back and laughed.</p>

<p>“I think if you can cry quits, I can,” he said. How the great load
rolled from off his heart as he saw Reddy, whom he had last beheld lying
prone at his feet, now his genial old self again!</p>

<p>“But, oh, Reddy, I did hate to hit you!”</p>

<p>“Ho, ho!” cried Reddy; “if it had kilt me intirely, Oi’d ’a’ been th’
last to complain! Is it true, Allan, that I was runnin’ around with
tramps?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s true, Reddy.”</p>

<p>“An’ hobnobbin’ with Dan Nolan?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“An’ abusin’ my missus?”</p>

<p>“You didn’t abuse her, Reddy.”</p>

<p>“An’ fightin’ my best friends, an’ wreckin’ railroad property, an’
actin’ generally loike a low-down haythen?” went on Reddy, rapidly.
“Why, th’ only thing I can’t forgive y’ fer, Allan, is thet y’ didn’t
knock me over th’ head long afore!”</p>

<p>“I would, Reddy,” laughed Allan, “if I’d thought it would cure you.”</p>

<p>“If it hadn’t cured me,” said Reddy, “it might ’a’ kilt me-an’ thet was
what I deserved!”</p>

<p>Joy is the best of all medicines, and Allan’s improvement was rapid. At
the end of a week he could spend hours lying back in a padded chair, and
Jack was finally prevailed upon to go regularly to work and leave the
care of the invalid to his wife.</p>

<p>It was on the platform before the station that the superintendent
stopped him one evening, as he was hurrying home from work.</p>

<p>“How are things out on the line?” he asked.</p>

<p>“All right, sir.”</p>

<p>“Going to win the track prize again this spring?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” and Jack grew suddenly grave. “One of my best men is laid up,
y’ know.”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” and the superintendent nodded. “How is the boy getting along,
Jack?”</p>

<p>“He’ll pull through,” said the other, slowly, “but he had a mighty close
call. If th’ bullet hadn’t struck a rib an’ glanced off, he’d ’a’ been
done fer. I went down t’ look at th’ place he got acrost th’ ravine, an’
I don’t see how he done it.”</p>

<p>“Neither do I,” agreed the superintendent. “I took a look at it, too.”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Jack, “th’ fever’s over now, an’ he’s gittin’ his
strength back.”</p>

<p>“And his appetite, too, I dare say.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” assented Jack, with a quick smile of enjoyment, “an’ his
appetite, too. Why, it does us more good t’ see him eat than to eat
ourselves.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it; but you mustn’t spoil the boy with too much
coddling.”</p>

<p>“Spoil him!” retorted Jack. “Not fer a minute! Why, y’ couldn’t spoil
him, sir. He’s pure gold, all th’ way through.”</p>

<p>The superintendent started on, stopped for an instant to chew his
moustache, then turned back.</p>

<p>“Jack!” he called.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” and the foreman stopped.</p>

<p>“You were saying,” began the superintendent, a little awkwardly, “that
the boy’s eating again. He ought to have some dainties, Welsh; oysters
and chicken and fruit, and that sort of thing.”</p>

<p>“We hope t’ be able t’ git ’em fer him, sir,” answered Jack, with
dignity.</p>

<p>“Well, the road won’t let you get them,” said the superintendent. “We
owe him a good deal, and we’re going to pay some of it this way. I’m
going to stop in over here at the store and tell Fisher to send the boy
whatever he wants and send the bill in to the road. I’ll see that it’s
paid. Of course, we’ll take care of the doctor and drug bills, too. Now,
maybe he’d like some oranges or pineapple or something of that sort
right away. Anyway, I’ll tell Fisher,” and he hurried on, as though
fearing to hear what the other might say.</p>

<p>Welsh looked after him for a moment without saying anything, then turned
toward home.</p>

<p>And Mr. Heywood, hurrying on, stopped at the grocery and gave certain
directions.</p>

<p>“And see here, Fisher,” he concluded, “you’ll send the bill to me, but
that’s nobody’s business but our own. I want them to think that the
road’s paying for it.”</p>

<p>Half an hour later, a grocer’s boy knocked at the door of the Welsh
cottage and handed in a great basket of dainties, and Allan was soon
smiling over a bowl of steaming oyster soup, with Jack and his wife and
Mamie grouped about the bed watching him enjoy it. And I don’t believe
there is any more exquisite pleasure in the world than that which they
experienced in that moment!</p>

<p>The winter days were clear and bright, and Allan found a rare enjoyment
in lying back in the great chair which Mrs. Welsh had padded expressly
for him, and looking out over the yards and watching the busy life
there. He was sitting so one afternoon when some one turned in at the
gate and mounted the path to the house.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s Misther Schofield!” cried Mary, and hastily dusted off a
chair with her apron, in honour of the distinguished visitor,—not that
it needed dusting.</p>

<p>The train-master came up with smiling face.</p>

<p>“How are you, Mrs. Welsh?” he asked. “And how is the invalid?”</p>

<p>He sat down by the side of the chair, and, reaching over, gave Allan’s
hand a hearty clasp.</p>

<p>“Do you know, I am ashamed of myself for not getting here before this,”
he went on, genially, “but I have kept posted about you, because I
wanted to know when you were ready to go back to work.”</p>

<p>“I’ll be ready before long, sir,” said Allan, smiling in sympathy with
his guest’s good humour. “I’m getting quite strong again.”</p>

<p>But Mrs. Welsh interrupted him.</p>

<p>“Listen at th’ boy!” she cried, indignantly. “Why, Misther Schofield,
an’ him with a bullethole clear through him t’ think o’ goin’ out an’
workin’ on section!”</p>

<p>The train-master was smiling more broadly than ever.</p>

<p>“It does seem pretty tough, doesn’t it?” he said. “Here’s a boy who’s
saved the company’s pay-car with two hundred thousand dollars in it, and
the lives of ten or fifteen men, and came within a hair’s breadth of
getting killed. And yet he has to work on section for forty dollars a
month. But then, there’s not so much danger on section any more; we’ve
routed the tramps, you know, for good and all. Still, it’s pretty
tough.”</p>

<p>“Tough!” and Mrs. Welsh looked at him with flaming eyes. “It’s worse ’n
that, beggin’ your pardon, sir. It’s a sin an’ a shame! It’s a disgrace
t’ th’ company!”</p>

<p>Allan tried to silence her, but she would not be silenced. He stole a
horrified glance at Mr. Schofield, and was astonished to see that he was
still smiling.</p>

<p>“A disgrace!” repeated that official. “Well, I agree with you, Mrs.
Welsh. So we’re not going to let him go back on section. We can’t afford
to waste a good man that way. It’s a little late for a Christmas gift,
maybe, but he’s earned it and he’s going to get it.”</p>

<p>Mary stared at the speaker, speechless.</p>

<p>“There’s a job open in my office, young man,” he went on, turning to
Allan. “It’s yours if you want it. It’s not such a very good job, for it
pays only fifty dollars a month, but you’ll learn more about railroading
there in a month than you can ever do on section, and you’ll be in line
for promotion, and you’ll get promoted when you merit it. What do you
say?”</p>

<p>What could Allan say, with a heart too full for utterance? He reached
out his hands blindly, and the other, understanding, clasped them in his
strong, steady ones.</p>

<hr class='tbk' />

<p>And that was how it came about that Allan got the place in the offices
which he had longed for, under the eye of the best train-master in the
West, where, as he had promised, there was more railroading to be
learned in a month than in a lifetime of section work. He became a part
of the brain which ruled and directed the whole wonderful system. He
came to know what the instruments ticking madly away on every table were
saying. He proved himself worthy of the trust reposed in him, and on two
critical occasions, at least, he displayed a nerve and quickness of
judgment which caused the general manager to ask the train-master:</p>

<p>“Who is this fellow named West you’ve got down there in your office,
Schofield? He seems a good one.”</p>

<p>“He <i>is</i> a good one,” Mr. Schofield had responded, earnestly. “You’ll
hear from him again.”</p>

<p>How the prophecy came true and what adventures befell Allan in his new
position will be told in “The Young Train-despatcher”; but, whatever his
successes, I doubt if he ever knew happier days than those he spent with
Reddy and Jack Welsh on Section Twenty-one.</p>

<p>There has been a constant demand for publication in separate form of
these two stories, which were originally included in two of the “Little

young.</p>

<p>“‘The Three Weavers’ is the daintiest fairy-story I ever read,” wrote
one critic, and the <i>Louisville Post</i> calls “In the Desert of Waiting” a
“gem, an exquisite bit of work. Mrs. Johnston is at her best in this web
of delicate fancy, woven about the deep centre truth.” Those who have
read the stories as they originally appeared will be glad to find them

<p>The charm of style and historical value of Miss Robinson’s previous
stories of child life in Puritan days have brought them wide popularity.
Her latest and most important book appeals to a large juvenile public.
The “knight errant” of this story is a little Don Quixote, whose trials

<p>12mo, cloth decorative, illustrated . . . $1.50</p>

<p>Here is a book which will grip and enthuse every boy who is lucky enough
to secure it. It is the story of a party of typical American lads,
courageous, alert, and athletic, who spend a summer camping on an island
off the Maine coast. Every boy reader will envy them their
adventures,—yacht-racing, canoeing, and camping,—which culminate in
their discovery and capture of a gang of daring robbers; but the
influence of wholesome, outdoor life in the development of manly
character is well brought out. Henry Burns, the leader of the boys, is a
character in juvenile fiction of whom we are likely to hear again.</p>

E. Stevenson</span>, author of “The Marathon Mystery,” etc.</p>

<p>12mo, cloth decorative, illustrated . . . $1.50</p>

<p>Every branch of railroading fascinates the average American boy. The
shops, the telegraph and signal systems, the yard and track work, the
daily life of danger which confronts every employee, whether he be the
ordinary workman or the engineer of a limited express train, and the
mysterious “office” which controls every branch of the work,—each holds
out its allurements to him.</p>

<p>In this story Mr. Stevenson’s hero is just the right sort, a manly lad
of sixteen who is given a chance as a section hand on a big Western
railroad, and whose experiences are as real as they are thrilling. He is
persecuted by the discharged employee whose place he took, and becomes
involved in complications which nearly cause his undoing; but his
manliness and courage are finally proven, and the reward is his for duty
done at any cost.</p>

<p>12mo, cloth decorative, illustrated . . . $1.00</p>

<p>The atmosphere of army life on the plains breathes on every page of this
delightful tale. The boy is the son of a captain of U. S. cavalry
stationed at a frontier post in the days when our regulars earned the
gratitude of a nation. His military training is begun at a very early
age; and how well he profits by the soldierly qualities of manhood and
honor and modesty and courtesy instilled is brought out in a series of
incidents and adventures which will appeal to every youngster, and to
many of their elders. Every phase of garrison life is included, for,
though an officer’s son, his friends range from the colonel commanding
to the trooper who taught him to ride his Indian pony.</p>

<p>The author is herself “of the army,” and knows every detail of the life.
From reveille to retreat her descriptions are accurate, which adds to
the value and interest of the book.</p>

M. Baxendale</span>. With nearly a hundred illustrations from photographs and
from drawings by Etheldred B. Barry.</p>

<p>Large 12mo, cloth decorative . . . $1.50</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxendale’s charming story, though written primarily for children,
will find a warm welcome from all those who love animals. It is a true
story of a deeply loved pet and companion of the author’s for thirteen
years; and it cannot fail to inspire in the hearts of all the young
people fortunate enough to hear it that affection and sympathy for
domestic animals so essential in the moulding of character.</p>

Little Christmas Shoe.”</p>

<p>12mo, cloth decorative, illustrated . . . $1.00</p>

<p>This is a charming little story of a child whose father was caretaker of
the great castle of the Wartburg, where St. Elizabeth once had her home,
with a fairy-tale interwoven in which the roses and the ivy in the
castle yard tell to the child and her playmate quaint old legends of the
saint and the castle. This is just the sort of a story that girls love,
with its sweetness and its fragrance and its faint echo of days long
gone, with a suspicion of present-day romance at the end.</p>

<p>No better description of this admirable book can be given than Mrs.
Whitney’s happy introduction:</p>

<p>“One might almost as well offer June roses with the assurance of their
sweetness, as to present this lovely little gathering of verse, which

Morrison’s charming volume has long been a delight to me, I am only too
happy to link my name with its new and enriched form in this slight way,
and simply declare that it is to me the most bewitching book of songs
for little people that I have ever known.”</p>

<p style='text-indent:0'><b>The Little Colonel.</b> (Trade Mark.)</p>

<p>The scene of this story is laid in Kentucky. Its heroine is a small
girl, who is known as the Little Colonel, on account of her fancied
resemblance to an old-school Southern gentleman, whose fine estate and
old family are famous in the region. This old Colonel proves to be the
grandfather of the child.</p>

<p style='text-indent:0'><b>The Giant Scissors.</b></p>

<p>This is the story of Joyce and of her adventures in France,—the
wonderful house with the gate of The Giant Scissors, Jules, her little
playmate, Sister Denisa, the cruel Brossard, and her dear Aunt Kate.
Joyce is a great friend of the Little Colonel, and in later volumes
shares with her the delightful experiences of the “House Party” and the
“Holidays.”</p>

<p style='text-indent:0'><b>Two Little Knights of Kentucky,</b> <span style='font-variant:small-caps'>Who Were the Little Colonel’s
Neighbors.</span></p>

<p>In this volume the Little Colonel returns to us like an old friend, but
with added grace and charm. She is not, however, the central figure of
the story, that place being taken by the “two little knights.”</p>

<p style='text-indent:0'><b>Cicely and Other Stories for Girls.</b></p>

<p>The readers of Mrs. Johnston’s charming juveniles will be glad to learn
of the issue of this volume for young people.</p>

boy, for his baby brother, is the theme of the simple tale.</p>

<p style='text-indent:0'><b>Ole Mammy’s Torment.</b></p>

<p>“Ole Mammy’s Torment” has been fitly called “a classic of Southern
life.” It relates the haps and mishaps of a small negro lad, and tells
how he was led by love and kindness to a knowledge of the right.</p>

<p style='text-indent:0'><b>The Story of Dago.</b></p>

<p>In this story Mrs. Johnston relates the story of Dago, a pet monkey,
owned jointly by two brothers. Dago tells his own story, and the account
of his haps and mishaps is both interesting and amusing.</p>

<p style='text-indent:0'><b>The Quilt That Jack Built.</b></p>

<p>A pleasant little story of a boy’s labor of love, and how it changed the
course of his life many years after it was accomplished.</p>

<p style='text-indent:0'><b>Flip’s Islands of Providence.</b></p>

<p>A story of a boy’s life battle, his early defeat, and his final triumph,
well worth the reading.</p>

another ride,—the ride of Anthony Severn,—which was no less historic in
its action or memorable in its consequences.”</p>

<p style='text-indent:0'><b>A Loyal Little Maid.</b></p>

<p>A delightful and interesting story of Revolutionary days, in which the
child heroine, Betsey Schuyler, renders important services to George
Washington.</p>

<p>This is an historical tale of a real girl, during the time when the
gallant Sir Harry Vane was governor of Massachusetts.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
